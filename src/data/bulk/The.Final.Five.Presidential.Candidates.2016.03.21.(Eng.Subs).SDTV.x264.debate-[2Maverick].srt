ADMINISTRATION.
HOW WOULD YOU BE BETTER?

HOW WOULD YOU BE BETTER?
HOW WOULD YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH

>> WELL, AS I SAID IN MY SPEECH
TODAY, AND IT REALLY IS BUILT ON

TODAY, AND IT REALLY IS BUILT ON
MY MANY YEARS GOING BACK TO THE

2950
01:17:19,854 --> 01:17:21,987
MY MANY YEARS GOING BACK TO THE
FIRST TIME I WENT TO ISRAEL 35

2951
01:17:21,989 --> 01:17:23,655
FIRST TIME I WENT TO ISRAEL 35
YEARS AGO AND THE WORK THAT I'VE

2952
01:17:23,657 --> 01:17:25,824
YEARS AGO AND THE WORK THAT I'VE
DONE, THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE KNOWN

2953
01:17:25,826 --> 01:17:29,261
DONE, THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE KNOWN
AND ADMIRED, I AM STAUNCHLY IN

2954
01:17:29,263 --> 01:17:31,897
AND ADMIRED, I AM STAUNCHLY IN
FAVOR OF ISRAEL'S SECURITY.

2955
01:17:31,899 --> 01:17:33,365
FAVOR OF ISRAEL'S SECURITY.
AND ALTHOUGH WE MAY HAVE

2956
01:17:33,367 --> 01:17:35,167
AND ALTHOUGH WE MAY HAVE
DIFFERENCES, WHICH WE DO, I

2957
01:17:35,169 --> 01:17:39,071
DIFFERENCES, WHICH WE DO, I
BELIEVE IN TREATING THOSE IN A

2958
01:17:39,073 --> 01:17:41,073
BELIEVE IN TREATING THOSE IN A
RESPECTFUL MANNER, CANDID BUT

2959
01:17:41,075 --> 01:17:42,040
RESPECTFUL MANNER, CANDID BUT
RESPECTFUL, WHICH IS WHAT I HAVE

2960
01:17:42,042 --> 01:17:42,941
RESPECTFUL, WHICH IS WHAT I HAVE
DONE IN THE PAST.

2961
01:17:42,943 --> 01:17:45,144
DONE IN THE PAST.
AND I THINK MY FIRM COMMITMENT

2962
01:17:45,146 --> 01:17:48,013
AND I THINK MY FIRM COMMITMENT
TO ISRAEL'S SECURITY PUTS ME ON

2963
01:17:48,015 --> 01:17:50,315
TO ISRAEL'S SECURITY PUTS ME ON
A VERY STRONG FOUNDATION TO DEAL

2964
01:17:50,317 --> 01:17:52,017
A VERY STRONG FOUNDATION TO DEAL
WITH WHATEVER THE QUESTIONS

2965
01:17:52,019 --> 01:17:54,486
WITH WHATEVER THE QUESTIONS
MIGHT BE IN THE RELATIONSHIP.

2966
01:17:54,488 --> 01:17:57,089
MIGHT BE IN THE RELATIONSHIP.
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE TO

2967
01:17:57,091 --> 01:17:58,257
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE TO
STAND AGAINST WHAT'S HAPPENING

2968
01:17:58,259 --> 01:18:00,192
STAND AGAINST WHAT'S HAPPENING
IN THE BROADER REGION, WHICH I

2969
01:18:00,194 --> 01:18:02,127
IN THE BROADER REGION, WHICH I
THINK IS NOT JUST A THREAT TO

2970
01:18:02,129 --> 01:18:03,962
THINK IS NOT JUST A THREAT TO
ISRAEL BUT A THREAT TO OUR OTHER

2971
01:18:03,964 --> 01:18:05,463
ISRAEL BUT A THREAT TO OUR OTHER
PARTNERS IN THE REGION AND EVEN

2972
01:18:05,465 --> 01:18:06,364
PARTNERS IN THE REGION AND EVEN
TO THE UNITED STATES.

2973
01:18:06,366 --> 01:18:09,067
TO THE UNITED STATES.
>> WHAT WAS THE DISCONNECT UNDER

2974
01:18:09,069 --> 01:18:10,169
>> WHAT WAS THE DISCONNECT UNDER
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION?

2977
01:18:11,906 --> 01:18:14,539
THAT.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE

2978
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:18,210
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE
VERY CLEAR THAT UNDER THE OBAMA

2979
01:18:18,212 --> 01:18:20,813
VERY CLEAR THAT UNDER THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION, ISRAEL HAS BEEN

2980
01:18:20,815 --> 01:18:24,883
ADMINISTRATION, ISRAEL HAS BEEN
GIVEN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

2981
01:18:24,885 --> 01:18:25,918
GIVEN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF
DEFENSIVE CAPABILITIES.

2982
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,686
DEFENSIVE CAPABILITIES.
I MENTIONED THE IRON DOME

2983
01:18:27,688 --> 01:18:28,887
I MENTIONED THE IRON DOME
MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM WHICH HAS

2984
01:18:28,889 --> 01:18:30,522
MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM WHICH HAS
WORKED VERY WELL AGAINST THE

ROCKETS COMING FROM GAZA BY

2986
01:18:35,162 --> 01:18:36,461
ROCKETS COMING FROM GAZA BY
HAMAS, AND THERE HAVE BEEN

2987
01:18:36,463 --> 01:18:36,795
HAMAS, AND THERE HAVE BEEN
DIFFERENCES.

2988
01:18:36,797 --> 01:18:38,931
DIFFERENCES.
BUT I THINK IN GENERAL, THE

2989
01:18:38,933 --> 01:18:40,432
BUT I THINK IN GENERAL, THE
RELATIONSHIP REMAINS VERY STRONG

2990
01:18:40,434 --> 01:18:41,967
RELATIONSHIP REMAINS VERY STRONG

LOOK, WE HAVE A RAUCOUS
DEMOCRACY.

3005
01:18:59,353 --> 01:19:01,987
DEMOCRACY.
ISRAEL HAS A RAUCOUS DEMOCRACY.

3006
01:19:01,989 --> 01:19:03,588
ISRAEL HAS A RAUCOUS DEMOCRACY.
I THINK THOSE OF US WHO ARE IN

COUNTRIES UNDERSTAND THAT A GIVE
AND TAKE BETWEEN FRIENDS IS THE

3011
01:19:13,934 --> 01:19:16,201
AND TAKE BETWEEN FRIENDS IS THE
BEST AND MOST HONEST WAY TO COME

BEST AND MOST HONEST WAY TO COME
TO ANY RESOLUTION.

SO, YES, I HAVE HAD MY

>> NO.
IN FACT, WE JUST DID A PRESS

3660
01:37:36,369 --> 01:37:37,301
IN FACT, WE JUST DID A PRESS
CONFERENCE AND GAVE A SPEECH

3661
01:37:37,303 --> 01:37:39,036
CONFERENCE AND GAVE A SPEECH
RIGHT HERE IN SALT LAKE CITY ON

3662
01:37:39,038 --> 01:37:41,472
RIGHT HERE IN SALT LAKE CITY ON
THE MIDDLE EAST AND ON ISRAEL,

3663
01:37:41,474 --> 01:37:43,073
THE MIDDLE EAST AND ON ISRAEL,
PRETTY MUCH THE SPEECH THAT I

3664
01:37:43,075 --> 01:37:45,008
PRETTY MUCH THE SPEECH THAT I
WOULD HAVE GIVEN TO AIPAC HAD I

3665
01:37:45,010 --> 01:37:46,544
WOULD HAVE GIVEN TO AIPAC HAD I
BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND THEIR

3666
01:37:46,546 --> 01:37:46,844
BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND THEIR
CONFERENCE.

3667
01:37:46,846 --> 01:37:48,713
CONFERENCE.
I WANTED TO BE THERE.

3668
01:37:48,715 --> 01:37:51,048
I WANTED TO BE THERE.
IT WAS SIMPLY A QUESTION OF

3669
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:51,349
IT WAS SIMPLY A QUESTION OF
SCHEDULING.

3670
01:37:51,351 --> 01:37:52,583
SCHEDULING.
>> YOU SAID THAT THE U.S. SHOULD

3671
01:37:52,585 --> 01:37:55,720
>> YOU SAID THAT THE U.S. SHOULD
BE EVEN-HANDED WHEN IT COMES TO

3672
01:37:55,722 --> 01:37:59,490
BE EVEN-HANDED WHEN IT COMES TO
DEALING WITH THE ISRAELIS AND

3673
01:37:59,492 --> 01:38:00,023
DEALING WITH THE ISRAELIS AND
PALESTINIANS.

3674
01:38:00,025 --> 01:38:01,692
PALESTINIANS.
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE U.S.

3675
01:38:01,694 --> 01:38:04,562
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE U.S.
SHOULD REMAIN NEUTRAL TO ACHIEVE

3676
01:38:04,564 --> 01:38:06,029
SHOULD REMAIN NEUTRAL TO ACHIEVE
MIDDLE EAST PEACE?

3677
01:38:06,031 --> 01:38:06,497
MIDDLE EAST PEACE?
>> NO.

3678
01:38:06,499 --> 01:38:08,299
>> NO.
IF WE WANT LASTING PEACE IN THE

3679
01:38:08,301 --> 01:38:09,400
IF WE WANT LASTING PEACE IN THE
MIDDLE EAST, WE'VE GOT TO

3680
01:38:09,402 --> 01:38:11,235
MIDDLE EAST, WE'VE GOT TO
OBVIOUSLY MAKE SURE THAT THE

3681
01:38:11,237 --> 01:38:13,804
OBVIOUSLY MAKE SURE THAT THE
SECURITY AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF

3682
01:38:13,806 --> 01:38:15,005
SECURITY AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF
ISRAEL REMAINS IN TACT.

3683
01:38:15,007 --> 01:38:17,475
ISRAEL REMAINS IN TACT.
THAT IS NOT A DEBATE.

3684
01:38:17,477 --> 01:38:20,077
THAT IS NOT A DEBATE.
ISRAEL MUST CONTINUE TO EXIST AS

3685
01:38:20,079 --> 01:38:22,112
ISRAEL MUST CONTINUE TO EXIST AS
AN INDEPENDENT FREE STATE.

3686
01:38:22,114 --> 01:38:24,615
AN INDEPENDENT FREE STATE.
BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

3687
01:38:24,617 --> 01:38:26,384
BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
LASTING PEACE, WE HAVE ALSO GOT

3688
01:38:26,386 --> 01:38:27,551
LASTING PEACE, WE HAVE ALSO GOT
TO WORK WITH THE PALESTINIANS.

3689
01:38:27,553 --> 01:38:30,120
TO WORK WITH THE PALESTINIANS.
AND WHAT THAT MEANS, WE HAVE GOT

3690
01:38:30,122 --> 01:38:33,157
AND WHAT THAT MEANS, WE HAVE GOT
TO RECOGNIZE, FOR EXAMPLE, IN

3691
01:38:33,159 --> 01:38:34,992
TO RECOGNIZE, FOR EXAMPLE, IN
GAZA, AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF

3692
01:38:34,994 --> 01:38:36,527
GAZA, AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF
44%, YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIVING IN

3693
01:38:36,529 --> 01:38:37,395
44%, YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIVING IN
HORRIFIC POVERTY.

3694
01:38:37,397 --> 01:38:39,963
HORRIFIC POVERTY.
YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT WAS

3695
01:38:39,965 --> 01:38:40,230
YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT WAS
DESTROYED.

3696
01:38:40,232 --> 01:38:41,632
DESTROYED.
SO IF WE ARE GOING TO GO

3697
01:38:41,634 --> 01:38:44,335
SO IF WE ARE GOING TO GO
FORWARD, IT CANNOT BE THAT THE

3698
01:38:44,337 --> 01:38:45,235
FORWARD, IT CANNOT BE THAT THE
UNITED STATES JUST TAKES THE

3699
01:38:45,237 --> 01:38:46,103
UNITED STATES JUST TAKES THE
SIDE OF ISRAEL.

3700
01:38:46,105 --> 01:38:47,905
SIDE OF ISRAEL.
WE'VE GOT TO WORK WITH BOTH

3701
01:38:47,907 --> 01:38:49,573
WE'VE GOT TO WORK WITH BOTH
COMMUNITIES TO TRY TO DO WHAT IS

3702
01:38:49,575 --> 01:38:50,408
COMMUNITIES TO TRY TO DO WHAT IS
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.

3703
01:38:50,410 --> 01:38:52,543
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.
AND THAT IS CREATE A LASTING

3704
01:38:52,545 --> 01:38:53,243
AND THAT IS CREATE A LASTING
PEACE IN THE REGION.

3705
01:38:53,245 --> 01:38:54,745
PEACE IN THE REGION.
>> DO YOU THINK THE U.S. HAS NOT

3706
01:38:54,747 --> 01:38:57,548
>> DO YOU THINK THE U.S. HAS NOT
BEEN EVEN-HANDED UP TILL NOW?

3707
01:38:57,550 --> 01:38:58,148
BEEN EVEN-HANDED UP TILL NOW?
>> RIGHT.

3708
01:38:58,150 --> 01:39:00,918
>> RIGHT.
I DO NOT THINK SO.

3709
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:03,654
I DO NOT THINK SO.
I THINK THAT OVERWHELMINGLY THE

3710
01:39:03,656 --> 01:39:04,888
I THINK THAT OVERWHELMINGLY THE
UNITED STATES TIME AND TIME

3711
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:07,325
UNITED STATES TIME AND TIME
AGAIN HAS LOOKED ASIDE WHEN

3712
01:39:07,327 --> 01:39:09,560
AGAIN HAS LOOKED ASIDE WHEN
ISRAEL HAS DONE SOME BAD THINGS.

3713
01:39:09,562 --> 01:39:12,029
ISRAEL HAS DONE SOME BAD THINGS.
I THINK, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THE

3714
01:39:12,031 --> 01:39:14,598
I THINK, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THE
GROWTH OF SETTLEMENTS IN

3715
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,334
GROWTH OF SETTLEMENTS IN
PALESTINIAN TERRITORY IS NOT

3716
01:39:16,336 --> 01:39:18,469
PALESTINIAN TERRITORY IS NOT
ACCEPTABLE TO ME, NOT CONDUCIVE

3717
01:39:18,471 --> 01:39:21,104
ACCEPTABLE TO ME, NOT CONDUCIVE
TO THE PEACE PROCESS.

3718
01:39:21,106 --> 01:39:24,107
TO THE PEACE PROCESS.
I THINK THAT THE KIND OF

3719
01:39:24,109 --> 01:39:27,778
I THINK THAT THE KIND OF
DESTRUCTION THAT WAS RACKED ON

3720
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:29,814
DESTRUCTION THAT WAS RACKED ON
GAZA DURING THAT WAR WAS WAY

3721
01:39:29,816 --> 01:39:32,049
GAZA DURING THAT WAR WAS WAY
ABOVE WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE FOR

3722
01:39:32,051 --> 01:39:32,750
ABOVE WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE FOR
MILITARY PURPOSES.

3723
01:39:32,752 --> 01:39:35,085
MILITARY PURPOSES.
A LOT OF CIVILIANS WERE KILLED.

3724
01:39:35,087 --> 01:39:39,724
A LOT OF CIVILIANS WERE KILLED.
A LOT OF HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS

3725
01:39:39,726 --> 01:39:41,392
A LOT OF HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS
AND APARTMENTS, ABOVE AND BEYOND

3726
01:39:41,394 --> 01:39:42,192
AND APARTMENTS, ABOVE AND BEYOND
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE.

3727
01:39:42,194 --> 01:39:44,161
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE.
SO LOOK, I THINK THERE IS NO

3728
01:39:44,163 --> 01:39:45,162
SO LOOK, I THINK THERE IS NO
QUESTION THAT THERE'S ENOUGH

3729
01:39:45,164 --> 01:39:46,897
QUESTION THAT THERE'S ENOUGH
BLAME TO GO AROUND ON BOTH

3730
01:39:46,899 --> 01:39:47,164
BLAME TO GO AROUND ON BOTH
SIDES.

3731
01:39:47,166 --> 01:39:49,233
SIDES.
ISRAEL HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFEND

3732
01:39:49,235 --> 01:39:51,235
ISRAEL HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFEND
ITSELF AGAINST TERRORIST

3733
01:39:51,237 --> 01:39:52,370
ITSELF AGAINST TERRORIST
ATTACKS, AGAINST HEZBOLLAH,

3734
01:39:52,372 --> 01:39:53,303
ATTACKS, AGAINST HEZBOLLAH,
AGAINST HAMAS.

3735
01:39:53,305 --> 01:39:55,806
AGAINST HAMAS.
BUT I THINK THE UNITED STATES IS

3736
01:39:55,808 --> 01:39:57,775
BUT I THINK THE UNITED STATES IS
STRONGER WHEN WE WORK WITH BOTH

3737
01:39:57,777 --> 01:39:58,008
STRONGER WHEN WE WORK WITH BOTH
SIDES.

3738
01:39:58,010 --> 01:40:00,611
SIDES.
>> SECRETARY CLINTON SAID THAT

3739
01:40:00,613 --> 01:40:03,080
>> SECRETARY CLINTON SAID THAT
SHE'S PRESIDED OVER FACE-TO-FACE

3740
01:40:03,082 --> 01:40:04,348
SHE'S PRESIDED OVER FACE-TO-FACE
MEETINGS BETWEEN PRIME MINISTER

3741
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:06,617
MEETINGS BETWEEN PRIME MINISTER
NETANYAHU, FOR INSTANCE, AND

3742
01:40:06,619 --> 01:40:08,853
NETANYAHU, FOR INSTANCE, AND
PRESIDENT ABBAS, THREE SEPARATE

3743
01:40:08,855 --> 01:40:09,253
PRESIDENT ABBAS, THREE SEPARATE
SESSIONS.

3744
01:40:09,255 --> 01:40:10,187
SESSIONS.
SHE SAYS SHE'S HAD A LOT OF

3745
01:40:10,189 --> 01:40:12,857
SHE SAYS SHE'S HAD A LOT OF
EXPERIENCE IN THIS REGION.

3746
01:40:12,859 --> 01:40:13,624
EXPERIENCE IN THIS REGION.
WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD DO A

3747
01:40:13,626 --> 01:40:14,958
WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD DO A
BETTER JOB THAN A PRESIDENT

3748
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:15,225
BETTER JOB THAN A PRESIDENT
CLINTON?

3749
01:40:15,227 --> 01:40:16,694
CLINTON?
>> WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

3750
01:40:16,696 --> 01:40:18,195
>> WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
BECAUSE I THINK I HAVE SHOWN A

3751
01:40:18,197 --> 01:40:19,963
BECAUSE I THINK I HAVE SHOWN A
LOT BETTER JUDGMENT THAN SHE HAS

3752
01:40:19,965 --> 01:40:21,532
LOT BETTER JUDGMENT THAN SHE HAS
ON FOREIGN POLICY.

3753
01:40:21,534 --> 01:40:23,033
ON FOREIGN POLICY.
LOOK, SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE

3754
01:40:23,035 --> 01:40:25,369
LOOK, SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE
FOR FOUR YEARS.

3755
01:40:25,371 --> 01:40:26,270
FOR FOUR YEARS.
AND IN THAT CAPACITY, YOU GAIN A

3756
01:40:26,272 --> 01:40:27,237
AND IN THAT CAPACITY, YOU GAIN A
LOT OF EXPERIENCE.

3757
01:40:27,239 --> 01:40:28,839
LOT OF EXPERIENCE.
BUT, IN FACT, WHEN SHE WAS IN

3758
01:40:28,841 --> 01:40:31,041
BUT, IN FACT, WHEN SHE WAS IN
THE SENATE, SHE HEARD THE SAME

3759
01:40:31,043 --> 01:40:33,010
THE SENATE, SHE HEARD THE SAME
EVIDENCE THAT I DID FROM GEORGE

3760
01:40:33,012 --> 01:40:35,078
EVIDENCE THAT I DID FROM GEORGE
BUSH AND DICK CHENEY ABOUT GOING

3761
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:36,213
BUSH AND DICK CHENEY ABOUT GOING
INTO IRAQ.

3762
01:40:36,215 --> 01:40:37,748
INTO IRAQ.
I NOT ONLY VOTED AGAINST THAT

3763
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:39,583
I NOT ONLY VOTED AGAINST THAT
WAR, I HELPED LEAD THE

3764
01:40:39,585 --> 01:40:40,851
WAR, I HELPED LEAD THE
OPPOSITION TO THAT WAR AND IF

OPPOSITION TO THAT WAR AND IF

HAD WITH HER A MONTH OR SO AGO,

PRAISING HER ACHIEVEMENTS.

PRAISING HER ACHIEVEMENTS.
IN MY VIEW, HENRY KISSINGER WAS

3788
01:41:30,703 --> 01:41:33,070
IN MY VIEW, HENRY KISSINGER WAS
ONE OF THE WORST SECRETARY OF

3789
01:41:33,072 --> 01:41:34,839
ONE OF THE WORST SECRETARY OF

I THINK THE STATUS QUO, IN

3866
01:43:34,393 --> 01:43:36,393
I THINK THE STATUS QUO, IN
GENERAL, I AM SYMPATHETIC TO

3867
01:43:36,395 --> 01:43:39,296
GENERAL, I AM SYMPATHETIC TO
WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE IN

3868
01:43:39,298 --> 01:43:41,565
WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE IN
THAT AREA AND I AM NOT HAPPY,

3869
01:43:41,567 --> 01:43:43,667
THAT AREA AND I AM NOT HAPPY,
FOR EXAMPLE, WITH SOME OF THE

3870

FOR EXAMPLE, WITH SOME OF THE
BEHAVIOR OF PRIME MINISTER

01:43:46,171 --> 01:43:46,470
BEHAVIOR OF PRIME MINISTER
NETANYAHU.

3872
01:43:46,472 --> 01:43:48,739
NETANYAHU.
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WENT TO A

3873
01:43:48,741 --> 01:43:50,407
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WENT TO A
JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS

3874
01:43:50,409 --> 01:43:51,875
JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS
WITHOUT EVEN NOTIFYING PRESIDENT

3875
01:43:51,877 --> 01:43:53,243
WITHOUT EVEN NOTIFYING PRESIDENT
OBAMA THAT HE WAS COMING.

3876
01:43:53,245 --> 01:43:55,445
OBAMA THAT HE WAS COMING.
SO, IN GENERAL, I THINK THAT,

3877
01:43:55,447 --> 01:43:56,513
SO, IN GENERAL, I THINK THAT,
YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA -- I

YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA -- I

YOU SAY IT DOESN'T ACHIEVE

3885
01:44:13,332 --> 01:44:15,499
YOU SAY IT DOESN'T ACHIEVE
EVERYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE.

EVERYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE AND THE

3887
01:44:16,201 --> 01:44:17,134
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE AND THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION LEFT OUT,

3888
01:44:17,136 --> 01:44:18,368
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION LEFT OUT,
DID NOT GET IN THE DEAL?

3889
01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:20,104
DID NOT GET IN THE DEAL?
>> WELL, THIS IS WHAT I THINK.

3890
01:44:20,106 --> 01:44:21,538
>> WELL, THIS IS WHAT I THINK.
I VERY STRONGLY SUPPORTED THE

3891
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:23,440
I VERY STRONGLY SUPPORTED THE
AGREEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT IRAN

3892
01:44:23,442 --> 01:44:25,042
AGREEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT IRAN
DID NOT GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

3893
01:44:25,044 --> 01:44:28,345
DID NOT GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
AND WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE

3894
01:44:28,347 --> 01:44:28,512
AND WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE
CAN.

3895
01:44:28,514 --> 01:44:30,614
CAN.
AND IF IRAN BREAKS THAT TREATY,

3896
01:44:30,616 --> 01:44:33,150
AND IF IRAN BREAKS THAT TREATY,
WE'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO

WE'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO
SANCTIONS REMAINS ON THE TABLE.

3898
01:44:34,586 --> 01:44:35,953
SANCTIONS REMAINS ON THE TABLE.
BUT IN A GENERAL SENSE, WHEN WE

3899
01:44:35,955 --> 01:44:38,421
BUT IN A GENERAL SENSE, WHEN WE
LOOK AT THE ENTIRE REGION, I

3900
01:44:38,423 --> 01:44:40,357
LOOK AT THE ENTIRE REGION, I
THINK WE HAVE GOT TO UNDERSTAND

3901
01:44:40,359 --> 01:44:43,326
THINK WE HAVE GOT TO UNDERSTAND
THAT IT'S NOT JUST IRAN THAT HAS

3902
01:44:43,328 --> 01:44:45,428
THAT IT'S NOT JUST IRAN THAT HAS
BEEN A BAD PLAYER AND THEY HAVE

3903
01:44:45,430 --> 01:44:47,330
BEEN A BAD PLAYER AND THEY HAVE
BEEN A BAD PLAYER.

3904
01:44:47,332 --> 01:44:49,166
BEEN A BAD PLAYER.
THEY HAVE SUPPORTED TERRORIST

THEY HAVE SUPPORTED TERRORIST

MAJOR COUNTRY IN THAT REGION,
SAUDI ARABIA.

3909
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:56,707
SAUDI ARABIA.
AND IF ANYONE THINKS THAT SAUDI

3910
01:44:56,709 --> 01:45:00,811
AND IF ANYONE THINKS THAT SAUDI
ARABIA IS A MODEL OF

3911
01:45:00,813 --> 01:45:02,146
ARABIA IS A MODEL OF
JEFFERSONIAN DEMOCRACY, YOU HAVE

REVOLUTION TOOK PLACE -- WHEN
WAS IT?

WAS IT?
1959?

4056
01:48:56,148 --> 01:48:58,815
1959?
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
WHAT I SAID, THE MAIN POINT THAT

4058
01:49:01,553 --> 01:49:02,852
WHAT I SAID, THE MAIN POINT THAT
I MADE, ANDERSON, IS THAT I

4059
01:49:02,854 --> 01:49:04,521
I MADE, ANDERSON, IS THAT I
DON'T THINK THAT THE UNITED

4060
01:49:04,523 --> 01:49:05,855
DON'T THINK THAT THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD GO

4061
01:49:05,857 --> 01:49:10,560
STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD GO
AROUND OVERTHROWING GOVERNMENTS.

4062
01:49:10,562 --> 01:49:17,167
AROUND OVERTHROWING GOVERNMENTS.
I THINK THE BAY OF PIGS WAS A

4063
01:49:17,169 --> 01:49:17,935
I THINK THE BAY OF PIGS WAS A
DISASTER.

4064
01:49:17,937 --> 01:49:20,637
DISASTER.
I THINK THE OVERTHROW OF THE

4065
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:22,539
I THINK THE OVERTHROW OF THE
DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT

4066
01:49:22,541 --> 01:49:23,907
DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT
IN GUATEMALA WAS A DISASTER.

4067
01:49:23,909 --> 01:49:26,310
IN GUATEMALA WAS A DISASTER.
I THINK THE OVERTHROW OF THE

4068
01:49:26,312 --> 01:49:27,844
I THINK THE OVERTHROW OF THE
DEMOCRATIC ELECTED PRIME

MINISTER IN IRAN WAS A DISASTER.

4070
01:49:29,648 --> 01:49:31,514
MINISTER IN IRAN WAS A DISASTER.
SO I DON'T THINK THE UNITED

4071
01:49:31,516 --> 01:49:33,150
SO I DON'T THINK THE UNITED
STATES HAS THE LEGAL OR MORAL

STATES HAS THE LEGAL OR MORAL
RIGHT TO GO AROUND OVERTHROWING

01:49:36,055 --> 01:49:37,821
RIGHT TO GO AROUND OVERTHROWING
GOVERNMENTS AND I THINK VERY
