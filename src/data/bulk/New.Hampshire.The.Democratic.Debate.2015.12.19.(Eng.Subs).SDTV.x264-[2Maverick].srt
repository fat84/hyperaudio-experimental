ON TWO OCCASIONS THERE WERE

00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,566
BREACHES IN INFORMATION.
TWO MONTHS AGO OUR STAFF FOUND

FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.

FIRST, TO GO AFTER THEM AND
DEPRIVE THEM OF THE TERRITORY

534
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:16,280
RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHAT TO
DO.

535
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:19,117
DO.
OBVIOUSLY, IN THE FIRST WE DO

536
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:22,520
OBVIOUSLY, IN THE FIRST WE DO
HAVE TO HAVE AN AMERICAN-LED AIR

551
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,176
THAT NOW INCLUDES THE INTERNET.
BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN THAT ISIS

552
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,046
BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN THAT ISIS
IS A VERY EFFECTIVE RECRUITER,

BUT I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE

00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,398
BUT I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE
IN OUR TECH EXPERTS, AND MAYBE

IN OUR TECH EXPERTS, AND MAYBE
THE BACK DOOR IS THE WRONG DOOR.

OTHERS ARE SAYING ABOUT THAT.

00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:44,915
TO OUR EARLY QUESTIONS, HOW DO
WE PREVENT ATTACKS, WELL, IF WE

WE PREVENT ATTACKS, WELL, IF WE
CAN'T KNOW WHAT SOMEONE IS

KNOW, THE MEMBER OF THE MOSQUE
OR THE TEACHER, SOMEBODY TO SEE

OR THE TEACHER, SOMEBODY TO SEE
SOMETHING.

SOMETHING.
I JUST THINK THERE'S GOT TO BE A

1266
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,096
I JUST THINK THERE'S GOT TO BE A
WAY, AND I WOULD HOPE THAT OUR

1267
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:00,964
WAY, AND I WOULD HOPE THAT OUR
TECH COMPANIES WOULD WORK WITH

1268
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:02,465
TECH COMPANIES WOULD WORK WITH
GOVERNMENT TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

1269
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,500
GOVERNMENT TO FIGURE THAT OUT.
OTHERWISE, LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

1270
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:04,767
OTHERWISE, LAW ENFORCEMENT IS
BLIND.

1271
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,870
BLIND.
BLIND BEFORE, BLIND DURING, AND

1272
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:09,206
BLIND BEFORE, BLIND DURING, AND
UNFORTUNATELY IN MANY INSTANCES

1273
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,040
UNFORTUNATELY IN MANY INSTANCES
BLIND AFTER.

1274
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:12,042
BLIND AFTER.
SO WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BALANCE

1275
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:15,011
SO WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BALANCE
LIBERTY AND SECURITY, PRIVACY

1276
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:17,714
LIBERTY AND SECURITY, PRIVACY
AND SAFETY, BUT I KNOW THAT LAW

1277
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:18,581
AND SAFETY, BUT I KNOW THAT LAW
ENFORCEMENT NEEDS THE TOOLS TO

1278
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,483
ENFORCEMENT NEEDS THE TOOLS TO
KEEP US SAFE.

1279
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,651
KEEP US SAFE.
AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE, THERE

1280
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:22,719
AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE, THERE
CAN BE SOME UNDERSTANDING AND

1281
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,054
CAN BE SOME UNDERSTANDING AND

PRIORITIZE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS

PRIORITIZE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS

00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:01,003
AND THAT WOULD I THINK GIVE THE
AMERICAN PUBLIC A BIT MORE OF A

THEY'VE ADVERTISED THAT.

THEY WANT AMERICAN TROOPS BACK

ASSAD FUTURE ON THE POLITICAL

THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION

1844

THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
WITH SECRETARY CLINTON ON THIS.

1845
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:11,767
WITH SECRETARY CLINTON ON THIS.
OUR DIFFERENCES ARE FAIRLY DEEP

1846
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:15,938
OUR DIFFERENCES ARE FAIRLY DEEP
ON THIS ISSUE.

1847
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,207
ON THIS ISSUE.
WE DISAGREED ON THE WAR IN IRAQ.

1848
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:19,741
WE DISAGREED ON THE WAR IN IRAQ.
WE BOTH LISTENED TO THE

1849
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,609
WE BOTH LISTENED TO THE
INFORMATION FROM BUSH AND

1850
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:21,177
INFORMATION FROM BUSH AND
CHENEY.

1851
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:21,977
CHENEY.
I VOTED AGAINST THE WAR.

1852
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:23,312
I VOTED AGAINST THE WAR.
BUT I THINK -- AND I SAY THIS

1853
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:23,946
BUT I THINK -- AND I SAY THIS
WITH DUE RESPECT.

1854
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:27,216
WITH DUE RESPECT.
THAT I WORRY TOO MUCH THAT

1855
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:29,151
THAT I WORRY TOO MUCH THAT
SECRETARY CLINTON IS TOO MUCH

1856
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:31,353
SECRETARY CLINTON IS TOO MUCH
INTO REGIME CHANGE AND A LITTLE

1857
00:51:31,355 --> 00:51:33,122
INTO REGIME CHANGE AND A LITTLE
BIT TOO AGGRESSIVE WITHOUT

1858
00:51:33,124 --> 00:51:36,992
BIT TOO AGGRESSIVE WITHOUT
KNOWING WHAT THE UNINTENDED

1859
00:51:36,994 --> 00:51:38,194
KNOWING WHAT THE UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCES MIGHT BE.

1860
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:40,495
CONSEQUENCES MIGHT BE.
YES, WE COULD GET RID OF SADDAM

1861
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,798
YES, WE COULD GET RID OF SADDAM
HUSSEIN, BUT THAT DESTABILIZED

1862
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,799
HUSSEIN, BUT THAT DESTABILIZED
THE ENTIRE REGION.

1863
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:45,968
THE ENTIRE REGION.
YES, WE COULD GET RID OF

1864
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:46,869
YES, WE COULD GET RID OF
GADHAFI, A TERRIBLE DICTATOR,

1865
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:50,505
GADHAFI, A TERRIBLE DICTATOR,
BUT THAT CREATED A VACUUM FOR

1866
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:51,140
BUT THAT CREATED A VACUUM FOR
ISIS.

1867
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:54,977
ISIS.
YES, WE COULD GET RID OF ASSAD

1868
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:56,645
YES, WE COULD GET RID OF ASSAD
TOMORROW, BUT THAT WOULD CREATE

1869
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:58,513
TOMORROW, BUT THAT WOULD CREATE
ANOTHER POLITICAL VACUUM THAT

1870
00:51:58,515 --> 00:51:59,348
ANOTHER POLITICAL VACUUM THAT
WOULD BENEFIT ISIS.

1871
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,782
WOULD BENEFIT ISIS.
SO I THINK YEAH, REGIME CHANGE

1872
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,484
SO I THINK YEAH, REGIME CHANGE
IS EASY, GETTING RID OF

1873
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,685
IS EASY, GETTING RID OF
DICTATORS IS EASY, BUT BEFORE

1874
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:05,120
DICTATORS IS EASY, BUT BEFORE
YOU DO THAT YOU'VE GOT TO THINK

1875
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,922
YOU DO THAT YOU'VE GOT TO THINK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS THE DAY

1876
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:07,156
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS THE DAY
AFTER.

1877
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:09,058
AFTER.
AND IN MY VIEW WHAT WE NEED TO

1878
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:12,027
AND IN MY VIEW WHAT WE NEED TO
DO IS PUT TOGETHER BROAD

1879
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:12,694
DO IS PUT TOGETHER BROAD
COALITIONS TO UNDERSTAND THAT

1880
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,865
COALITIONS TO UNDERSTAND THAT
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A

1881
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:17,366
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A
POLITICAL VACUUM FILLED BY

1882
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:18,133
POLITICAL VACUUM FILLED BY
TERRORISTS, THAT IN FACT WE ARE

1883
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:21,103
TERRORISTS, THAT IN FACT WE ARE
GOING TO MOVE STEADILY AND MAYBE

1884
00:52:21,105 --> 00:52:22,771
GOING TO MOVE STEADILY AND MAYBE
SLOWLY TOWARD DEMOCRATIC

1885
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:23,038
SLOWLY TOWARD DEMOCRATIC
SOCIETIES.

1886
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,242
SOCIETIES.
IN TERMS OF ASSAD, A TERRIBLE

1887
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:27,642
IN TERMS OF ASSAD, A TERRIBLE
DICTATOR, BUT I THINK IN SYRIA

1888
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:33,148
DICTATOR, BUT I THINK IN SYRIA
THE PRIMARY FOCUS NOW MUST BE

1889
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:33,949
THE PRIMARY FOCUS NOW MUST BE
DESTROYING ISIS AND WORKING OVER

DESTROYING ISIS AND WORKING OVER
THE YEARS TO GET RID OF ASSAD.

1891
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,719
THE YEARS TO GET RID OF ASSAD.
THAT'S THE SECONDARY ISSUE.

THAT'S THE SECONDARY ISSUE.

THE HIGHEST IF NOT THE HIGHEST
IN THE COUNTRY.

3122
01:26:45,301 --> 01:26:49,135

SO STATES OVER A PERIOD OF
DECADES HAVE PUT THEIR MONEY

I THINK THAT WHAT LIBYA THEN DID
BY HAVING A FULL FREE ELECTION

BY HAVING A FULL FREE ELECTION

IN LIBYA RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE
HAS BEEN A FRAGILE AGREEMENT TO
