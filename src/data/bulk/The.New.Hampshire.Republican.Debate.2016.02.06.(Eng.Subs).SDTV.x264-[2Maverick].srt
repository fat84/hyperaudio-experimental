I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DIDN'T
GET TO DO THAT AND I HAVE SOME

REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING THAT
MAKES SENSE.

1727

MAKES SENSE.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

1728
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:57,354
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
AND THE REASON THAT I DISLIKE

1729
00:45:57,356 --> 00:45:58,789
AND THE REASON THAT I DISLIKE
OBAMA CARE IS BECAUSE THE

1730
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:01,926
OBAMA CARE IS BECAUSE THE
GOVERNMENT COMES IN AND TELLS

GOVERNMENT COMES IN AND TELLS
THE PEOPLE, WHICH, THE NATION IS

YOU DON'T LIKE IT, TOO BAD.

1735
00:46:07,566 --> 00:46:08,865
YOU DON'T LIKE IT, TOO BAD.
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

1736
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:10,901
THAT'S A PROBLEM.
AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT,

1737
00:46:10,903 --> 00:46:12,002
AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT,
BECAUSE THAT WILL CHANGE

EMPOWERMENT ACCOUNT SYSTEM.
EVERYBODY GETS AN ACCOUNT THE

1742
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:18,542
EVERYBODY GETS AN ACCOUNT THE
DAY THEY ARE BORN, THEY KEEP IT

1743
00:46:18,544 --> 00:46:19,343
DAY THEY ARE BORN, THEY KEEP IT
UNTIL THEY DIE.

1744
00:46:19,345 --> 00:46:20,277
UNTIL THEY DIE.
THEY CAN PASS IT ON.

1745
00:46:20,279 --> 00:46:21,511
THEY CAN PASS IT ON.
WE PAY FOR IT WITH THE SAME

1746
00:46:21,513 --> 00:46:23,414
WE PAY FOR IT WITH THE SAME
DOCTORS THAT WE PAY FOR

1747
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:25,215
DOCTORS THAT WE PAY FOR
TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE WITH,

TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE WITH,
RECOGNIZING THAT WE SPEND TWICE

HEALTH CARE AND DON'T HAVE AS
SUCH ACCESS.

1752
00:46:32,224 --> 00:46:33,457
SUCH ACCESS.
WE GIVE PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO

1753
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:35,225
WE GIVE PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO
SHIFT MONEY WITHIN THEIR HEALTH

00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:37,694
SHIFT MONEY WITHIN THEIR HEALTH
EMPOWERMENT ACCOUNT, SO THAT

1755
00:46:37,696 --> 00:46:39,629
EMPOWERMENT ACCOUNT, SO THAT
EACH FAMILY BASICALLY BECOMES

1756
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,231
EACH FAMILY BASICALLY BECOMES
ITS OWN INSURANCE COMPANY

1757
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:43,200
ITS OWN INSURANCE COMPANY
WITHOUT A MIDDLEMAN THAT SAVES

1758
00:46:43,202 --> 00:46:45,069
WITHOUT A MIDDLEMAN THAT SAVES
YOU A LOT OF MONEY.

1759
00:46:45,071 --> 00:46:46,437
YOU A LOT OF MONEY.

AND THAT WILL LOWER THE COST OF
YOUR CATASTROPHIC INSURANCE

>> WELL, I THINK CONSERVATISM IS
ABOUT THREE THINGS.

2090
00:55:44,843 --> 00:55:47,243
ABOUT THREE THINGS.
THE FIRST IS CONSERVATISM IS

2091
00:55:47,245 --> 00:55:49,446
THE FIRST IS CONSERVATISM IS
ABOUT LIMITED GOVERNMENT.

2092
00:55:49,448 --> 00:55:50,714
ABOUT LIMITED GOVERNMENT.
ESPECIALLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

2093
00:55:50,716 --> 00:55:52,415
ESPECIALLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

2094
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:53,717
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS
LIMITED BY THE CONSTITUTION,

2095
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:56,186
LIMITED BY THE CONSTITUTION,
WHICH DELINEATES ITS POWERS.

2096
00:55:56,188 --> 00:55:57,153
WHICH DELINEATES ITS POWERS.
IF IT IS NOT IN THE

2097
00:55:57,155 --> 00:55:58,088
IF IT IS NOT IN THE
CONSTITUTION, IT DOES NOT BELONG

2098
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,489
CONSTITUTION, IT DOES NOT BELONG
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

2099
00:55:59,491 --> 00:56:02,158
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
IT BELONGS TO STATES,

2100
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:02,459
IT BELONGS TO STATES,
COMMUNITIES.

2101
00:56:02,461 --> 00:56:05,261
COMMUNITIES.
IT IS ABOUT FREE ENTERPRISE.

2102
00:56:05,263 --> 00:56:06,663
IT IS ABOUT FREE ENTERPRISE.
IT ALLOWS EVERYONE TO SURVIVE

2103
00:56:06,665 --> 00:56:07,731
IT ALLOWS EVERYONE TO SURVIVE
WITHOUT PULLING ANYONE DOWN.

2104
00:56:07,733 --> 00:56:09,199
WITHOUT PULLING ANYONE DOWN.
THE REASON WHY FREE ENTERPRISE

2105
00:56:09,201 --> 00:56:10,767
THE REASON WHY FREE ENTERPRISE
IS THE GREATEST ECONOMIC MODEL

ISIS IS NOT JUST A JIHADIST

ISIS IS NOT JUST A JIHADIST

HAPPEN.

THE REASON WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO

2590
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:22,799
THE REASON WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO
UNDERSTAND THAT IS BECAUSE THESE

2591
01:08:22,801 --> 01:08:23,966
UNDERSTAND THAT IS BECAUSE THESE
ARE NOT GROUPS THAT ARE JUST

ARE NOT GROUPS THAT ARE JUST
GOING TO GO AWAY ON THEIR OWN.

THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO THE
DEFEATED.

2595
01:08:27,572 --> 01:08:28,805
DEFEATED.
AND I BELIEVE THEY NEED TO BE

2596
01:08:28,807 --> 01:08:30,172
AND I BELIEVE THEY NEED TO BE
DEFEATED AND THE GROUND, BY A

2597
01:08:30,174 --> 01:08:32,174
DEFEATED AND THE GROUND, BY A
GROUND FORCE, MADE UP OF SUNNI

GROUND FORCE, MADE UP OF SUNNI
ARABS.

ARABS.
IT WILL TAKE SUNNI ARABS TO

01:08:34,579 --> 01:08:37,480
IT WILL TAKE SUNNI ARABS TO
REJECT THEM AND DEFEAT THEM

REJECT THEM AND DEFEAT THEM
MILITARILY.

2602
01:08:37,782 --> 01:08:39,281
MILITARILY.
THAT WILL REQUIRE COALITION OF

IT ALL BEGINS BY TAKING AWAY
THEIR THEY OPERATING SPACES.

ALREADY SAID ISIS IS THE MOST

DANGEROUS JIHADIST GROUP IN THE
HISTORY OF MANKIND.

HISTORY OF MANKIND.
SO, THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE

2624
01:09:30,835 --> 01:09:31,534
SO, THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE
DAUNG RO

2625

DANGEROUS THAN AL QAEDA, THE

INSURGENTS IN IRAQ.

FIGHT THOSE GROUPS.

2630
01:09:36,408 --> 01:09:38,007

SO, IF ISIS IS THE MOST

2631
01:09:38,009 --> 01:09:40,342
SO, IF ISIS IS THE MOST
DANGEROUS GROUP IN HISTORY, WHY

2632
01:09:40,344 --> 01:09:42,077
DANGEROUS GROUP IN HISTORY, WHY
NOT COMMIT A LARGE U.S. GROUND

01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:42,445
NOT COMMIT A LARGE U.S. GROUND

SUNNI CITIES AND VILLAGES CAN

AND WHY THAT IS IMPORTANT IS

AND WHY THAT IS IMPORTANT IS
BECAUSE IF SUNNIS ARE NOT ABLE

01:14:03,574 --> 01:14:05,274
IN THIS CASE.
THIS IS THE LESSON LEARNED, IN

2801
01:14:05,276 --> 01:14:07,710
THIS IS THE LESSON LEARNED, IN
HISTORY, IF YOU BOMB SOMETHING

2802
01:14:07,712 --> 01:14:09,178
HISTORY, IF YOU BOMB SOMETHING
AND NOT DO ANYTHING AS IT

2803
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:10,079
AND NOT DO ANYTHING AS IT
RELATES TO DEAL WITH THE

2804
01:14:10,081 --> 01:14:12,314
RELATES TO DEAL WITH THE
AFTERMATH OF THIS, IF YOU DON'T

2805
01:14:12,316 --> 01:14:13,115
AFTERMATH OF THIS, IF YOU DON'T
HAVE A STABLE GOVERNMENT, YOU

2806
01:14:13,117 --> 01:14:15,117
HAVE A STABLE GOVERNMENT, YOU
GET WHAT WE HAVE IN LIBYA.

2807
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:16,852
GET WHAT WE HAVE IN LIBYA.
AND THIS IS NOT LEADING FROM

2808
01:14:16,854 --> 01:14:17,352
AND THIS IS NOT LEADING FROM
BEHIND.

2809
01:14:17,354 --> 01:14:18,721
BEHIND.
IT'S NOT AN EFFECTIVE POLICY.

2810
01:14:18,723 --> 01:14:19,521
IT'S NOT AN EFFECTIVE POLICY.
WE HAVE TO LEAD.

2811
01:14:19,523 --> 01:14:20,790
WE HAVE TO LEAD.
WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES,

2812
01:14:20,792 --> 01:14:21,657
WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES,
NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK.

2813
01:14:21,659 --> 01:14:23,859
NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK.
EUROPE DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY

2814
01:14:23,861 --> 01:14:26,062
EUROPE DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY
TO LEAD FORWARDLY IN THIS

2815
01:14:26,064 --> 01:14:26,328
TO LEAD FORWARDLY IN THIS
REGARD.

2816
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:28,630
REGARD.
AND SO, DEALING WITH THE

2817
01:14:28,632 --> 01:14:29,665
AND SO, DEALING WITH THE
CALIPHATE IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE

2818
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:31,500
CALIPHATE IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE
IT NOW HAS SPAWNED OTHER AREAS.

2819
01:14:31,502 --> 01:14:34,203
IT NOW HAS SPAWNED OTHER AREAS.
THERE HAVE BEEN 70-PLUS ATTACKS

2820
01:14:34,205 --> 01:14:35,738
THERE HAVE BEEN 70-PLUS ATTACKS
IN 17 COUNTRIES, EITHER INSPIRED

2821
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:38,074
IN 17 COUNTRIES, EITHER INSPIRED
BY ISIS OR ORGANIZED BY ISIS.

2822
01:14:38,076 --> 01:14:39,075
BY ISIS OR ORGANIZED BY ISIS.
LIBYA BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT

2823
01:14:39,077 --> 01:14:39,541
LIBYA BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT
ONE NOW.

2824
01:14:39,543 --> 01:14:41,243
ONE NOW.
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

2825
01:14:41,245 --> 01:14:42,845
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE
CALIPHATE WITH BUILDING A SUNNI

2826
01:14:42,847 --> 01:14:44,580
CALIPHATE WITH BUILDING A SUNNI
ARMY THERE, BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL

2827
01:14:44,582 --> 01:14:45,414
ARMY THERE, BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL
WITH IT IN LIBYA.

2828
01:14:45,416 --> 01:14:46,682
WITH IT IN LIBYA.
I THINK THE UNITED STATES,

2829
01:14:46,684 --> 01:14:48,250
I THINK THE UNITED STATES,
ULTIMATELY, IS GOING TO PLAY A

2830
01:14:48,252 --> 01:14:49,284
ULTIMATELY, IS GOING TO PLAY A
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THIS.

2831
01:14:49,286 --> 01:14:51,386
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THIS.
THE PROBLEM WITH THE OBAMA

2832
01:14:51,388 --> 01:14:52,955
THE PROBLEM WITH THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION IS THAT THEY SEE

2833
01:14:52,957 --> 01:14:54,056
ADMINISTRATION IS THAT THEY SEE
THIS INCREMENTALLY.

2834
01:14:54,058 --> 01:14:55,057
THIS INCREMENTALLY.
THEY'RE RELUCTANT.

2835
01:14:55,059 --> 01:14:55,524
THEY'RE RELUCTANT.
THEY DON'T LEAD.

2836
01:14:55,526 --> 01:14:57,159
THEY DON'T LEAD.
NO ONE KNOWS IF WE'RE SERIOUS

2837
01:14:57,161 --> 01:14:59,128
NO ONE KNOWS IF WE'RE SERIOUS
AND WHEN WE DO IT, WE DO IT IN

2838
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:01,197
AND WHEN WE DO IT, WE DO IT IN
INCREMENTS YOU CAN BARELY SEE.

2839
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:01,864
INCREMENTS YOU CAN BARELY SEE.
THE UNITED STATES HAS TO LEAD IN

2840
01:15:01,866 --> 01:15:02,798
THE UNITED STATES HAS TO LEAD IN
A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE WAY THAN

2841
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,333
A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE WAY THAN
WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.

01:15:04,335 --> 01:15:08,804
WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.

I THINK I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO

I THINK I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO
START TALKING ABOUT IT.

01:15:22,019 --> 01:15:24,854
START TALKING ABOUT IT.
I SAY, WE HAVE TO HAVE A PRO

I SAY, WE HAVE TO HAVE A PRO
ACTIVE FOREIGN POLICY STRATEGY.

AND, OF COURSE, THE NEXT PLACE

AND, OF COURSE, THE NEXT PLACE
THAT ISIS IS GOING TO ATTACK TO

THAT ISIS IS GOING TO ATTACK TO
IS LIBYA.

IF YOU WANT TO EXPAND YOUR

CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.

3090
01:21:38,129 --> 01:21:40,662
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.

THE REASON I CAN END COMMON CORE

3106
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:09,324
THE REASON I CAN END COMMON CORE
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS BECAUSE

3107
01:22:09,326 --> 01:22:13,895
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS BECAUSE
OBAMA IS ABUSING EXECUTIVE POWER

01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:17,633
FORCE IT ON THE STATES.
THAT'S ONE AVENUE.

3111
01:22:17,635 --> 01:22:20,935
THAT'S ONE AVENUE.
THE SECOND AVENUE OF CHANGE IS

3112
01:22:20,937 --> 01:22:21,303
THE SECOND AVENUE OF CHANGE IS

THE FASTEST.
IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THAT IRAN

01:22:26,177 --> 01:22:28,377
IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THAT IRAN
RELEASED OUR HOSTAGES THE DAY

RELEASED OUR HOSTAGES THE DAY
REAGAN WAS SWORN IN.
