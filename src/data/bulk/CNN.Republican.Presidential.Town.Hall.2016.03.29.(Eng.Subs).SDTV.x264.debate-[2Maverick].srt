UP SURROUNDED BY STRONG WOMEN.

1544
00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:43,549
UP SURROUNDED BY STRONG WOMEN.
MY MOM IS SOMEONE WHO I ADMIRE

1545
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:44,050
MY MOM IS SOMEONE WHO I ADMIRE
IMM

1546
00:41:44,052 --> 00:41:44,317
IMM
IMMENSELY.

1547
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,352
IMMENSELY.
MY MOM IS IRISH-ITALIAN.

1548
00:41:46,354 --> 00:41:48,321
MY MOM IS IRISH-ITALIAN.
SHE GREW UP IN WILMINGTON,

1549
00:41:48,323 --> 00:41:48,587
SHE GREW UP IN WILMINGTON,
DELAWARE.

1550
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,689
DELAWARE.
SHE GREW UP IN A WORKING-CLASS

1551
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:51,157
SHE GREW UP IN A WORKING-CLASS
FAMILY.

1552
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:54,493
FAMILY.
HER MOM WAS THE SECOND YOUNGEST

1553
00:41:54,495 --> 00:41:57,096
HER MOM WAS THE SECOND YOUNGEST
OF 17 KIDS, AND MY MOM BECAME

1554
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,131
OF 17 KIDS, AND MY MOM BECAME
THE FIRST PERSON IN HER FAMILY

1555
00:41:58,133 --> 00:42:01,534
THE FIRST PERSON IN HER FAMILY
EVER TO GO TO COLLEGE.

1556
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:03,602
EVER TO GO TO COLLEGE.
AND THAT WAS NOT EASY FOR HER

1557
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:08,107
AND THAT WAS NOT EASY FOR HER
BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER, HER DAD,

1558
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,710
BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER, HER DAD,
HE WAS NOT AN EASY MAN.

1559
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:14,447
HE WAS NOT AN EASY MAN.
HE WAS A DRUNK AND HE DIDN'T

1560
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:15,581
HE WAS A DRUNK AND HE DIDN'T
THINK WOMEN SHOULD BE EDUCATED.

1561
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:17,783
THINK WOMEN SHOULD BE EDUCATED.
AND SO MY MOM STOOD UP TO HER

1562
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,017
AND SO MY MOM STOOD UP TO HER
FATHER.

1563
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:19,218
FATHER.
SHE TODAY UP TO HIM, CONFRONTED

1564
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:24,690
SHE TODAY UP TO HIM, CONFRONTED

MAJORED IN MATH IN 1956 AND SHE

1566
00:42:26,561 --> 00:42:28,394
MAJORED IN MATH IN 1956 AND SHE
GOT HIRED AT SHELL AS A COMPUTER

1567
00:42:28,396 --> 00:42:30,396
GOT HIRED AT SHELL AS A COMPUTER
PROGRAMMER.

1568
00:42:30,398 --> 00:42:31,965

TELL ME A LOT WHEN I WAS A KID,

1576
00:42:43,511 --> 00:42:45,378
TELL ME A LOT WHEN I WAS A KID,
SHE SAID, SHE VERY DELIBERATELY

SHE SAID, SHE VERY DELIBERATELY
DIDN'T LEARN HOW TO TYPE.

1578
00:42:46,914 --> 00:42:48,314

WAS LIVING IN.

1581
00:42:50,285 --> 00:42:52,185

SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE WALKING

1582
00:42:52,187 --> 00:42:54,553
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE WALKING
DOWN THE HALL AND HAVE SOME MAN

1583
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:56,555
DOWN THE HALL AND HAVE SOME MAN
STOP HER AND SAY, SWEETHEART,

1585
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,694

01:55:06,216 --> 01:55:07,916
NOT JUST A MILITARY ORGANIZATION
BUT AN INTELLIGENCE GATHERING

01:55:27,338 --> 01:55:29,137
IS IT?
>> OF COURSE IT'S NOT.

4225
01:55:29,139 --> 01:55:30,238

THAT'S WHY THEY DIDN'T EVEN
CATCH THIS STUFF IN BRUSSELS.

4237
01:55:51,628 --> 01:55:53,895
CATCH THIS STUFF IN BRUSSELS.
NATO HAS AN ADDITIONAL ROLE NOW

01:55:53,897 --> 01:55:55,230
NATO HAS AN ADDITIONAL ROLE NOW
AND THAT IS POLICING AND

THEIR JOB IS TO DISRUPT.
THAT'S WHY THE ISSUE OF APPLE

4274

THAT'S WHY THE ISSUE OF APPLE
WAS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY
