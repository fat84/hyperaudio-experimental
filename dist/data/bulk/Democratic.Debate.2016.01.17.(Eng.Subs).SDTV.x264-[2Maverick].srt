PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO GO AFTER
THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ONCE THERE

2381
01:12:14,436 --> 01:12:17,470
THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ONCE THERE
WAS A POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY TO

2382
01:12:17,472 --> 01:12:19,172
WAS A POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY TO
BUILD ON WHEN THE RUSSIANS

01:12:19,174 --> 01:12:20,840
BUILD ON WHEN THE RUSSIANS
OPENED THAT DOOR, RESULTED IN A

2384
01:12:20,842 --> 01:12:21,974
OPENED THAT DOOR, RESULTED IN A
VERY POSITIVE OUTCOME.

2385
01:12:21,976 --> 01:12:22,709
VERY POSITIVE OUTCOME.
WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE CHEMICAL

2386
01:12:22,711 --> 01:12:29,182
WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS OUT.

2387
01:12:29,184 --> 01:12:29,916
WEAPONS OUT.
I KNOW FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS

01:12:32,954 --> 01:12:33,653
SECRETARY OF STATE THAT WE WERE
DEEPLY WORRIED ABOUT ASSAD'S

2390
01:12:33,655 --> 01:12:35,522
DEEPLY WORRIED ABOUT ASSAD'S
FORCES USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS

2391
01:12:35,524 --> 01:12:38,391
FORCES USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS
BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE HAD NOT

2392
01:12:38,393 --> 01:12:40,860
BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE HAD NOT
ONLY A HORRIFIC AFFECT ON PEOPLE

2393
01:12:40,862 --> 01:12:43,463
ONLY A HORRIFIC AFFECT ON PEOPLE
IN SYRIA, BUT IT COULD VERY WELL

2394
01:12:43,465 --> 01:12:46,866
IN SYRIA, BUT IT COULD VERY WELL
HAVE AFFECTED THE SURROUNDING
