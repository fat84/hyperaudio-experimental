286
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,221
SO, YES, THIS HAS DEVELOPED.
I THINK THAT THERE ARE MANY

287
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:39,224
I THINK THAT THERE ARE MANY
OTHER REASONS WHY IT HAS IN

288
00:09:39,226 --> 00:09:40,692
OTHER REASONS WHY IT HAS IN
ADDITION TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

289
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:43,094
ADDITION TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
REGION, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT

290
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:45,363
REGION, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT
THE UNITED STATES HAS THE BULK

291
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:46,364
THE UNITED STATES HAS THE BULK
OF THE RESPONSIBILITY.

292
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:47,732
OF THE RESPONSIBILITY.
I REALLY PUT THAT ON ASSAD AND

293
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:50,000
I REALLY PUT THAT ON ASSAD AND
ON THE IRAQIS AND ON THE REGION

294
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:50,235
ON THE IRAQIS AND ON THE REGION
ITSELF.

295
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:51,168
ITSELF.
>> OKAY, GOVERNOR O'MALLEY,

ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO
ISIS.

299
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:56,441
ISIS.
IF THE UNITED STATES DOESN'T

300
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:57,041
IF THE UNITED STATES DOESN'T
LEAD, WHO LEADS?

BECAUSE I THINK ALL OF US ON
THIS STAGE AGREE THAT WE NEED

1543
00:44:29,948 --> 00:44:31,113
THIS STAGE AGREE THAT WE NEED
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM

1544
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:33,583
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
WITH A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP.

A PART OF THAT DEBATE.

1547
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,389
A PART OF THAT DEBATE.
AND IT IS A FACT THAT THE NET

IMMIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND

SOUTH HAS BASICALLY ZEROED OUT.

1550
00:44:44,462 --> 00:44:46,963

SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO SAY,

1551
00:44:46,965 --> 00:44:49,098
SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO SAY,
LOOK, WE HAVE 11 MILLION PEOPLE

THEY HAVE CHILDREN WHO ARE DOING
SO WELL, I'VE MET AND WORKED

SO WELL, I'VE MET AND WORKED
WITH DREAMERS.

1557
00:44:58,610 --> 00:44:59,809
WITH DREAMERS.
I THINK ANY PARENT WOULD BE SO

1558
00:44:59,811 --> 00:45:00,843
I THINK ANY PARENT WOULD BE SO
PROUD OF THEM.

1559
00:45:00,845 --> 00:45:02,778
PROUD OF THEM.
SO LET'S MOVE TOWARD WHAT WE

1560
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,714
SO LET'S MOVE TOWARD WHAT WE
SHOULD BE DOING AS A NATION AND
