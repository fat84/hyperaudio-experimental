178
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,136
NEIGHBORING STATE.
AND I THINK WE HAVE SUPPORT,

179
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:07,037

BECAUSE PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS

180
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,306
BECAUSE PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS
HAVE SEEN THE WORK THAT I AM

181
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,275
HAVE SEEN THE WORK THAT I AM

00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:20,875
TOWARD UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE,
WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE,

01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:25,112
THAT THEY CAN BE SUSTAINED ON
BUT AT SOME POINT DON'T WANT TO

2175
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:26,247
BUT AT SOME POINT DON'T WANT TO

01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:24,498
I DID THAT IN LARGE MEASURE
MOTIVATED BY MY DEEP CONCERN

01:13:04,112 --> 01:13:06,079
YOU KNOW, I DID MAKE A MISTAKE
AND I ADMITTED THAT I MADE A

2384
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,982
AND I ADMITTED THAT I MADE A
MISTAKE AND IN LARGE MEASURE

2385
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:14,888
MISTAKE AND IN LARGE MEASURE
THAT MISTAKE REALLY AROSE FROM

2386
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,090
THAT MISTAKE REALLY AROSE FROM
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S

2387
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:21,528
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S
APPROACH TO WHAT THEY THOUGHT

2388
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:22,128
APPROACH TO WHAT THEY THOUGHT
THEY COULD ACCOMPLISH IN IRAQ.

2389
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:25,198
THEY COULD ACCOMPLISH IN IRAQ.
THE VERY EXPLICIT APPEAL THAT

2390
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,233
THE VERY EXPLICIT APPEAL THAT
PRESIDENT BUSH MADE BEFORE

2391
01:13:27,235 --> 01:13:28,501
PRESIDENT BUSH MADE BEFORE
ANNOUNCING THE INVASION THAT

2392
01:13:28,503 --> 01:13:30,971
ANNOUNCING THE INVASION THAT
GETTING THAT VOTE WOULD BE A

2393
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:32,806
GETTING THAT VOTE WOULD BE A
STRONG PIECE OF LEVERAGE IN

2394
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:37,578
STRONG PIECE OF LEVERAGE IN
ORDER TO FINISH THE INSPECTIONS.

2395
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:41,214
ORDER TO FINISH THE INSPECTIONS.
AND HE MADE THAT COMMENT.

2396
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:43,850
AND HE MADE THAT COMMENT.
AND THE U.N. INSPECTOR SAID GIVE

2397
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:46,486
AND THE U.N. INSPECTOR SAID GIVE
US THE TIME, WE WILL FIND OUT,

2398
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:48,488
US THE TIME, WE WILL FIND OUT,
GIVE US THE HAMMER OVER THEIR

2399
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:49,856
GIVE US THE HAMMER OVER THEIR
HEAD, NAMELY THE VOTE, AND WE

2400
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:52,325
HEAD, NAMELY THE VOTE, AND WE
WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT WHAT

2401
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:58,364
WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT WHAT
THEY STILL HAVE IN TERMS OF WMD.

2402
01:13:58,366 --> 01:13:59,399
THEY STILL HAVE IN TERMS OF WMD.
AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION

2403
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,768
AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION
DIDN'T GIVE THEM THE TIME.

2404
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:05,706
DIDN'T GIVE THEM THE TIME.
AND THAT WAS A BREACH OF FAITH

2405
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:07,474
AND THAT WAS A BREACH OF FAITH
IN MY VIEW.

2406
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:10,176
IN MY VIEW.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I GAVE THEM THE

2407
01:14:10,178 --> 01:14:11,478
BUT, YOU KNOW, I GAVE THEM THE
VOTE IN LARGE MEASURE BECAUSE I

2408
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,613
VOTE IN LARGE MEASURE BECAUSE I
THOUGHT THAT WOULD GIVE US THE

2409
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:16,149
THOUGHT THAT WOULD GIVE US THE
TIME AND WE WOULD FIND OUT SHORT

2410
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:17,084
TIME AND WE WOULD FIND OUT SHORT
OF INVASION.

2411
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:20,988
OF INVASION.
TURNED OUT NOT TO BE AND I

2412
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,723
TURNED OUT NOT TO BE AND I
REALLY REGRET THAT THAT'S THE

2413
01:14:22,725 --> 01:14:24,357
REALLY REGRET THAT THAT'S THE
WAY PRESIDENT BUSH PROCEEDED.

2414
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:25,626
WAY PRESIDENT BUSH PROCEEDED.
THAT WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING YOU

2415
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:26,660
THAT WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING YOU
WOULD HAVE TO BE WORRY ABOUT

YOU KNOW, I CAN LAUGH UP HERE
BUT IT'S NOT EASY.

2432
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:03,897
BUT IT'S NOT EASY.
IT IS A BRUTAL EXPERIENCE.

2433
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:05,298
IT IS A BRUTAL EXPERIENCE.
WHEN IT FIRST STARTED HAPPENING

2434
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,668
WHEN IT FIRST STARTED HAPPENING
TO ME BACK IN THE EARLY 90s WHEN

2435
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,970
TO ME BACK IN THE EARLY 90s WHEN
I WAS WORKING ON HEALTH CARE

2436
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:12,605
I WAS WORKING ON HEALTH CARE
AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST

2437
01:15:12,607 --> 01:15:13,506
AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST
UNRECOGNIZABLE TO MYSELF WHAT

2438
01:15:13,508 --> 01:15:17,811
UNRECOGNIZABLE TO MYSELF WHAT
TALK RADIO WAS SAYING, WHAT

2439
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:18,779
TALK RADIO WAS SAYING, WHAT
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

2440
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:20,714
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
AND THEIR ALLIES WERE SAYING.

2441
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:22,282
AND THEIR ALLIES WERE SAYING.
I WAS JUST STUNNED.

2442
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:24,751
I WAS JUST STUNNED.
I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THEY

2443
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,386
I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THEY
GOT AWAY WITH IT.

2444
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:29,622
GOT AWAY WITH IT.
AND I HAVE HAD TO LEARN TO TAKE

2445
01:15:29,624 --> 01:15:31,158
AND I HAVE HAD TO LEARN TO TAKE
CRITICISM SERIOUSLY BUT NOT

2446
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:31,457
CRITICISM SERIOUSLY BUT NOT
PERSONALLY.

2447
01:15:31,459 --> 01:15:34,427
PERSONALLY.
AND BY THAT I MEAN THIS -- THE

2448
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:37,330
AND BY THAT I MEAN THIS -- THE
VERY FAIR QUESTION FROM REBECCA.

2449
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:40,967
VERY FAIR QUESTION FROM REBECCA.

SERIOUSLY.

2452
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:45,205
SERIOUSLY.
THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED

2453
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:46,339
THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
OFTEN FROM PEOPLE WHO DON'T

IT PERSONALLY SO THAT IT JUST

2456
01:15:54,183 --> 01:15:55,515
IT PERSONALLY SO THAT IT JUST
PARALYZES YOU, LITERALLY STOPS

01:46:30,851 --> 01:46:32,150
SOMEBODY ELSE?
AND I'M SURE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

SHE WOULD BE ENCOURAGING ME,
SHE'D BE VERY PROUD, A LITTLE

3380
01:46:39,827 --> 01:46:41,326
SHE'D BE VERY PROUD, A LITTLE
APPREHENSIVE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

3381
01:46:41,328 --> 01:46:43,228
APPREHENSIVE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT'S A BRUTAL BUSINESS BEING IN

3382
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:45,463
IT'S A BRUTAL BUSINESS BEING IN
POLITICS AND PEOPLE SAY THINGS

3383
01:46:45,465 --> 01:46:46,965
POLITICS AND PEOPLE SAY THINGS
ABOUT THOSE YOU LOVE, WHETHER

3384
01:46:46,967 --> 01:46:49,534
ABOUT THOSE YOU LOVE, WHETHER
IT'S YOUR DAUGHTER OR SOMEONE

3385
01:46:49,536 --> 01:46:49,935
IT'S YOUR DAUGHTER OR SOMEONE
ELSE.

3386
01:46:49,937 --> 01:46:51,937
ELSE.
SO SHE WAS -- SHE WAS VERY

3387
01:46:51,939 --> 01:46:54,539
SO SHE WAS -- SHE WAS VERY
SUPPORTIVE BUT YOU COULD TELL,

3388
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:56,674

OF ABSORBED FROM TIME TO TIME.

3390
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,847

SO I WOULD SIT WITH HER AND I

3391
01:47:01,849 --> 01:47:03,781
SO I WOULD SIT WITH HER AND I
WOULD SAY DON'T LISTEN TO THAT

3392
01:47:03,783 --> 01:47:04,282
WOULD SAY DON'T LISTEN TO THAT
STUFF, MOM.

3393
01:47:04,284 --> 01:47:06,218

KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT

3395
01:47:07,687 --> 01:47:08,019
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT
YOU.

3396
01:47:08,021 --> 01:47:10,055
