BUT I BELIEVE THAT WHAT HUMAN

1428

NATURE IS ABOUT IS THAT

00:47:22,115 --> 00:47:24,249
NATURE IS ABOUT IS THAT
EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM IMPACTS

EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM IMPACTS
EVERYBODY ELSE IN ALL KINDS OF

EVERYBODY ELSE IN ALL KINDS OF
WAYS THAT WE CAN'T EVEN

00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,785
WAYS THAT WE CAN'T EVEN
UNDERSTAND.

1433
00:47:27,787 --> 00:47:29,187
UNDERSTAND.
IT'S BEYOND INTELLECT.

1434
00:47:29,189 --> 00:47:31,423
IT'S BEYOND INTELLECT.
IT'S A SPIRITUAL EMOTIONAL

1435
00:47:31,425 --> 00:47:31,889
IT'S A SPIRITUAL EMOTIONAL
THING.

1436
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,891

SO I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE DO THE

1437
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,927
SO I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE DO THE
RIGHT THING, WHEN WE TRY TO

1438
00:47:35,929 --> 00:47:37,395
RIGHT THING, WHEN WE TRY TO
TREAT PEOPLE WITH RESPECT AND

00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:41,399
TREAT PEOPLE WITH RESPECT AND
DIGNITY, WHEN WE SAY THAT THAT

CHILD WHO IS HUNGRY IS MY CHILD,

00:47:44,538 --> 00:47:47,572
CHILD WHO IS HUNGRY IS MY CHILD,
I THINK WE ARE MORE HUMAN WHEN

1442
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:48,973
I THINK WE ARE MORE HUMAN WHEN
WE DO THAT THAN WHEN WE SAY THIS

WE DO THAT THAN WHEN WE SAY THIS
WHOLE WORLD IS ME, I NEED MORE

CAUSE SERIOUS PROBLEMS.
I CALLED FOR REINING IN CEO PAY,

I CALLED FOR REINING IN CEO PAY,
I CALLED FOR ENDING THE LOOPHOLE

1715
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:42,813
I CALLED FOR ENDING THE LOOPHOLE

GET A LOWER TAX RATE.

1717
00:55:44,084 --> 00:55:45,383
GET A LOWER TAX RATE.
I HAVE BEEN ON RECORD FOR A

1718

I HAVE BEEN ON RECORD FOR A
REALLY LONG TIME.

1719
00:55:47,587 --> 00:55:48,286
REALLY LONG TIME.
I'VE NOW PUT FORTH A PLAN, IT'S

1720
00:55:48,288 --> 00:55:51,022
I'VE NOW PUT FORTH A PLAN, IT'S
IN PUBLIC ARENA.

1721
00:55:51,024 --> 00:55:53,457
IN PUBLIC ARENA.
I WANT TO PEOPLE TO HOLD ME

THAT'S WHAT I'D DO.

1724
00:55:54,227 --> 00:55:55,927
THAT'S WHAT I'D DO.
THE OTHER PART OF THIS I FIND

1725
00:55:55,929 --> 00:55:57,195
THE OTHER PART OF THIS I FIND
SOMEWHAT CONCERNING, ACTUALLY,

1726
00:55:57,197 --> 00:55:58,729
SOMEWHAT CONCERNING, ACTUALLY,
IS THE ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE THAT

1727
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:00,564
IS THE ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE THAT
IF YOU EVER TOOK MONEY FROM ANY

1728
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:03,434
IF YOU EVER TOOK MONEY FROM ANY
BUSINESS, OF ANY KIND, THEN YOU

1729
00:56:03,436 --> 00:56:04,702
BUSINESS, OF ANY KIND, THEN YOU
CAN'T FULFILL YOUR PUBLIC

1730
00:56:04,704 --> 00:56:05,103
CAN'T FULFILL YOUR PUBLIC
RESPONSIBILITIES.

1731
00:56:05,105 --> 00:56:06,271
RESPONSIBILITIES.
WELL, THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE.

1732
00:56:06,273 --> 00:56:08,907
WELL, THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE.
I MEAN, PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK AN

1733
00:56:08,909 --> 00:56:09,874
I MEAN, PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK AN
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY, MORE

1734
00:56:09,876 --> 00:56:11,609
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY, MORE
THAN ANYBODY EVER HAD FROM WALL

1735
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:13,111
THAN ANYBODY EVER HAD FROM WALL
STREET IN 2008 WHEN HE WAS

1736
00:56:13,113 --> 00:56:14,379
STREET IN 2008 WHEN HE WAS
SUCCESSFUL IN HIS ELECTION, AND

1737
00:56:14,381 --> 00:56:16,381
SUCCESSFUL IN HIS ELECTION, AND
THEN HE TURNED AROUND AND PUSHED

1738
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:18,349
THEN HE TURNED AROUND AND PUSHED
THROUGH THE TOUGHEST REGULATIONS

1739
00:56:18,351 --> 00:56:19,884
THROUGH THE TOUGHEST REGULATIONS
THAT WE'VE SEEN SINCE THE GREAT

1740
00:56:19,886 --> 00:56:20,218
THAT WE'VE SEEN SINCE THE GREAT
DEPRESSION.

1741
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,652
DEPRESSION.
SO THE ARGUMENT JUST DOESN'T

1742
00:56:21,654 --> 00:56:23,421
SO THE ARGUMENT JUST DOESN'T
HOLD UP, BUT, AGAIN, YOU KNOW,

1743
00:56:23,423 --> 00:56:24,622
HOLD UP, BUT, AGAIN, YOU KNOW,
IF EVERYBODY'S GOING TO DO THE

1744
00:56:24,624 --> 00:56:27,025
IF EVERYBODY'S GOING TO DO THE
SAME THING, THEN I'LL BE PART OF

1745
00:56:27,027 --> 00:56:27,325
SAME THING, THEN I'LL BE PART OF
IT.

1746
00:56:27,327 --> 00:56:28,893
IT.
>> WE WILL CONTINUE TO WAIT,

1747
00:56:28,895 --> 00:56:30,061
>> WE WILL CONTINUE TO WAIT,
THEN, AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS ON

1748
00:56:30,063 --> 00:56:31,229
THEN, AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS ON
THAT ISSUE, BUT THERE ARE OTHERS

1749
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,432
THAT ISSUE, BUT THERE ARE OTHERS
THAT MUST BE COVERED, OF COURSE.

1750
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:35,466
THAT MUST BE COVERED, OF COURSE.

DECISION ABOUT WHERE THE

DECISION ABOUT WHERE THE
TRANSFERS WOULD GO.

1772
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:07,898

OF CLOSING GUANTANAMO FOR A LONG

1777
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:18,009

TIME.
SINCE 2008.

1779
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:20,544
SINCE 2008.
WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE

1780
00:57:20,546 --> 00:57:23,481
WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE

1781
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:24,482
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE

TO FIND PLACES THAT COULD TAKE

1783

BACK SOME OF THE PRISONERS JUST
AS PRESIDENT BUSH HAD DONE

AS PRESIDENT BUSH HAD DONE
BEFORE PRESIDENT OBAMA.

1786
00:57:31,724 --> 00:57:33,391
BEFORE PRESIDENT OBAMA.
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT

I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT
TO TRY TO CLOSE IT.

1788
00:57:34,727 --> 00:57:39,163
TO TRY TO CLOSE IT.
I THINK IT IS A CONTINUING

I THINK IT IS A CONTINUING
RECRUITMENT ADVERTISEMENT FOR

CONGRESS WILL WORK WITH HIM,
CHRIS, BECAUSE THERE IS NO

REASON FOR US TO CONTINUE TO

WOULD DO US HARM AND TRY TO
RECRUIT OTHERS TO DO US HARM.

1802
00:58:03,623 --> 00:58:05,323
RECRUIT OTHERS TO DO US HARM.
SO WHERE THEY END UP SHOULD BE A

SO WHERE THEY END UP SHOULD BE A
MATTER OF NEGOTIATION.

1804
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:07,158
MATTER OF NEGOTIATION.
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT

I KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT
WANTS TO DO.

1806

CENTER IN 1993.

1817
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:30,448
CENTER IN 1993.
THE PRESIDENT'S TRYING TO FIGURE

1818
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,882
THE PRESIDENT'S TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT TO DO WITH PEOPLE WHO

1819
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:34,485
OUT WHAT TO DO WITH PEOPLE WHO
ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO BE

1820
00:58:34,487 --> 00:58:39,057
ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO BE
RELEASED, WHO HAVE TO BE

01:31:22,086 --> 01:31:25,221
IT.
ANOTHER WAY OF DOING IT IS

2949
01:31:25,223 --> 01:31:25,954
ANOTHER WAY OF DOING IT IS
EXPANDING THE SOCIAL SECURITY

2950
01:31:25,956 --> 01:31:27,756
EXPANDING THE SOCIAL SECURITY
TAX TO INVESTMENT INCOME,

2951
01:31:27,758 --> 01:31:28,890
TAX TO INVESTMENT INCOME,
SO-CALLED PASSIVE INCOME,

2952
01:31:28,892 --> 01:31:30,593
SO-CALLED PASSIVE INCOME,
BECAUSE A LOT OF WELL-OFF PEOPLE

2953
01:31:30,595 --> 01:31:32,328
BECAUSE A LOT OF WELL-OFF PEOPLE
DON'T MAKE A LOT OF WHAT WE

2954
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:34,463
DON'T MAKE A LOT OF WHAT WE
WOULD THINK OF AS EARNED INCOME

2955
01:31:34,465 --> 01:31:35,431
WOULD THINK OF AS EARNED INCOME
BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF INCOME

2956
01:31:35,433 --> 01:31:37,799
BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF INCOME
BECAUSE IT COMES FROM CAPITAL

2957
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:39,368
BECAUSE IT COMES FROM CAPITAL
GAINS AND INVESTMENT AND OTHER

2958
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:39,602
GAINS AND INVESTMENT AND OTHER
SOURCES.

2959
01:31:39,604 --> 01:31:41,704
SOURCES.
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

2960
01:31:41,706 --> 01:31:42,671
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT
SOMETHING LIKE EITHER ONE OF

2961
01:31:42,673 --> 01:31:42,871
SOMETHING LIKE EITHER ONE OF
THOSE.

2962
01:31:42,873 --> 01:31:44,673
THOSE.
THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER IDEAS,

2963
01:31:44,675 --> 01:31:46,475
THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER IDEAS,
BUT I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I

2964
01:31:46,477 --> 01:31:48,677
BUT I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I
CAN TO EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE

2965
01:31:48,679 --> 01:31:50,346
CAN TO EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE
SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND.

2966
01:31:50,348 --> 01:31:51,780
SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND.
AND IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT,

2967
01:31:51,782 --> 01:31:55,351
AND IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT,
THOUGH, TO LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO

2968
01:31:55,353 --> 01:31:58,354
THOUGH, TO LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO
ARE NOT GETTING BY ON WHAT THEY

2969
01:31:58,356 --> 01:31:58,987
ARE NOT GETTING BY ON WHAT THEY
CURRENTLY HAVE UNDER SOCIAL

2970
01:31:58,989 --> 01:31:59,255
CURRENTLY HAVE UNDER SOCIAL
SECURITY.

2971
01:31:59,257 --> 01:32:01,890
SECURITY.
THERE ARE A LOT OF LOW-WAGE

2972
01:32:01,892 --> 01:32:02,824
THERE ARE A LOT OF LOW-WAGE
WORKERS WHO DIDN'T MAKE MUCH,

2973
01:32:02,826 --> 01:32:04,493
WORKERS WHO DIDN'T MAKE MUCH,
AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR

2974
01:32:04,495 --> 01:32:04,760
AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR
THEM.

2975
01:32:04,762 --> 01:32:07,028
THEM.
THERE ARE A LOT OF WOMEN WHO

2976
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:10,432
THERE ARE A LOT OF WOMEN WHO
WERE NOT IN THE FORMAL

2977
01:32:10,434 --> 01:32:10,699
WERE NOT IN THE FORMAL
WORKFORCE.

2978
01:32:10,701 --> 01:32:11,333
WORKFORCE.
YOU'VE BEEN A PROFESSIONAL,

2979
01:32:11,335 --> 01:32:12,401
YOU'VE BEEN A PROFESSIONAL,
YOU'VE WORKED FOR ALL THOSE

2980
01:32:12,403 --> 01:32:14,136
YOU'VE WORKED FOR ALL THOSE
YEARS BUT A LOT OF WOMEN MAY

2981
01:32:14,138 --> 01:32:16,639
YEARS BUT A LOT OF WOMEN MAY
HAVE BEEN IN, MAY HAVE BEEN OUT,

2982
01:32:16,641 --> 01:32:17,273
HAVE BEEN IN, MAY HAVE BEEN OUT,
MAY HAVE RAISED CHILDRENS MAY

2983
01:32:17,275 --> 01:32:22,645
MAY HAVE RAISED CHILDRENS MAY
HAVE CARED FOR AN ILL RELATIVE.

2984
01:32:22,647 --> 01:32:23,779
HAVE CARED FOR AN ILL RELATIVE.
THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF WHAT

2985
01:32:23,781 --> 01:32:24,413
THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF WHAT
THEY

2986
01:32:24,415 --> 01:32:25,514
THEY
THEY'VE EARNED IN THE SOCIAL

2987
01:32:25,516 --> 01:32:26,014
THEY'VE EARNED IN THE SOCIAL
SECURITY TRUST FUND.

2988
01:32:26,016 --> 01:32:27,349
SECURITY TRUST FUND.
THEN THE OTHER GROUP I'M

2989
01:32:27,351 --> 01:32:28,651
THEN THE OTHER GROUP I'M
CONCERNED ABOUT ARE WIDOWS WHO

2990
01:32:28,653 --> 01:32:29,551
CONCERNED ABOUT ARE WIDOWS WHO
LOSE HALF THEIR BENEFIT WHEN

2991
01:32:29,553 --> 01:32:31,153
LOSE HALF THEIR BENEFIT WHEN
THEIR HUSBAND DIES.

2992
01:32:31,155 --> 01:32:34,055
THEIR HUSBAND DIES.
SO I WANT TO PREVENT IT FROM

2993
01:32:34,057 --> 01:32:36,425
SO I WANT TO PREVENT IT FROM
BEING PRIVATIZED.

2994
01:32:36,427 --> 01:32:39,395
BEING PRIVATIZED.
I WANT TO EXTEND THE SOCIAL

2995
01:32:39,397 --> 01:32:40,296
I WANT TO EXTEND THE SOCIAL
SECURITY TRUST FUND, AND I WANT

2996
01:32:40,298 --> 01:32:44,099
SECURITY TRUST FUND, AND I WANT
TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE UP THE

2997
01:32:44,101 --> 01:32:45,567
TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE UP THE
BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

2998
01:32:45,569 --> 01:32:46,669
BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE
LITERALLY BARELY HANGING ON.

2999
01:32:46,671 --> 01:32:47,803
LITERALLY BARELY HANGING ON.
THE THREE GROUPS I MENTIONED ARE

3000
01:32:47,805 --> 01:32:52,207
THE THREE GROUPS I MENTIONED ARE
THE ONES I'M LOOKING AT MOST

3001
01:32:52,209 --> 01:32:52,641
THE ONES I'M LOOKING AT MOST
CL

3002
01:32:52,643 --> 01:32:52,874
CL
CLOSELY.

3003
01:32:52,876 --> 01:32:53,809
CLOSELY.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE WE

3004
01:32:53,811 --> 01:32:55,511
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE WE
EXTEND IT AND IT WILL BE THERE

3005
01:32:55,513 --> 01:32:57,479
EXTEND IT AND IT WILL BE THERE
SO YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME

3006
01:32:57,481 --> 01:32:59,214
SO YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME
KIND OF GUARANTEE YOU DID AND I

KIND OF GUARANTEE YOU DID AND I
DID WHEN WE STARTED OUT.

3008
01:33:00,418 --> 01:33:01,283
DID WHEN WE STARTED OUT.

STATE THAT OFFER MORE
INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS THAN REQUIRED

3017
01:33:17,535 --> 01:33:18,667
INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS THAN REQUIRED
BY LAW.

3018
01:33:18,669 --> 01:33:21,637
BY LAW.
WE OFFER 230 INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS

VERSUS THE TRADITIONAL 180.

3020
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:23,972
VERSUS THE TRADITIONAL 180.
YOU LOOK AT COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA

3021
01:33:23,974 --> 01:33:25,507
YOU LOOK AT COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA
AND CHINA, THEY OFFER, THEY

3022
01:33:25,509 --> 01:33:26,942
AND CHINA, THEY OFFER, THEY
REQUIRE THEIR HIGH SCHOOL

3023
01:33:26,944 --> 01:33:28,877
REQUIRE THEIR HIGH SCHOOL
STUDENTS TO ATTEND 220 DAYS ON

3024
01:33:28,879 --> 01:33:29,110
STUDENTS TO ATTEND 220 DAYS ON
AVERAGE.

3025
01:33:29,112 --> 01:33:31,012
AVERAGE.
AND THAT'S 40 DAYS MORE THAN OUR

AND THAT'S 40 DAYS MORE THAN OUR
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.

3027
01:33:31,649 --> 01:33:32,914
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.
DO YOU THINK THAT PUTS OUR

3028
01:33:32,916 --> 01:33:35,884
DO YOU THINK THAT PUTS OUR
STUDENTS AT A DISADVANTAGE?

3029
01:33:35,886 --> 01:33:37,553
STUDENTS AT A DISADVANTAGE?
AND IF SO, WOULD YOU WORK WITH

3030
01:33:37,555 --> 01:33:39,855
AND IF SO, WOULD YOU WORK WITH
STATES TO HELP MODERNIZE THAT

3031
01:33:39,857 --> 01:33:40,088
STATES TO HELP MODERNIZE THAT
POLICY?

3032
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:41,724
POLICY?
>> HERE'S WHAT I THINK IT DOES,

3033
01:33:41,726 --> 01:33:43,291
>> HERE'S WHAT I THINK IT DOES,
AND THANK YOU FOR BEING INVOLVED

AND THANK YOU FOR BEING INVOLVED
IN EDUCATION.

3035
01:33:44,027 --> 01:33:46,395
IN EDUCATION.
IT'S SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

3036
01:33:46,397 --> 01:33:50,966
IT'S SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.
I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

3037
01:33:50,968 --> 01:33:52,668
I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON
DISADVANTAGED KIDS, LOW-INCOME

3038
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:55,504
DISADVANTAGED KIDS, LOW-INCOME
KIDS, KIDS WITH LEARNING

3039
01:33:55,506 --> 01:33:56,938
KIDS, KIDS WITH LEARNING
DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE THEY DO

3040
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:58,340
DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE THEY DO
NEED MORE TIME ON TASK.

3041
01:33:58,342 --> 01:34:00,476
NEED MORE TIME ON TASK.
OTHERS COULD ALSO BENEFIT FROM

3042
01:34:00,478 --> 01:34:01,710
OTHERS COULD ALSO BENEFIT FROM
IT, BUT WE UNDERSTAND AND YOU

3043
01:34:01,712 --> 01:34:04,446
IT, BUT WE UNDERSTAND AND YOU
DO, I'M SURE, FROM THE RESEARCH,

3044
01:34:04,448 --> 01:34:07,015
DO, I'M SURE, FROM THE RESEARCH,
THAT THE MORE TIME THAT KIDS WHO

3045
01:34:07,017 --> 01:34:09,485
THAT THE MORE TIME THAT KIDS WHO
NEED THAT TIME HAVE, THE MORE

3046
01:34:09,487 --> 01:34:11,019
NEED THAT TIME HAVE, THE MORE
LIKELY THEY WILL MAKE GAINS IN

3047
01:34:11,021 --> 01:34:11,987
LIKELY THEY WILL MAKE GAINS IN
THEIR LEARNING.

3048
01:34:11,989 --> 01:34:13,589
THEIR LEARNING.
IN FACT, THERE'S A LOT OF

3049
01:34:13,591 --> 01:34:15,090
IN FACT, THERE'S A LOT OF
RESEARCH WHICH SHOWS THAT, YOU

3050
01:34:15,092 --> 01:34:18,960
RESEARCH WHICH SHOWS THAT, YOU
KNOW, FOR MOST MIDDLE CLASS OR

3051
01:34:18,962 --> 01:34:20,829
KNOW, FOR MOST MIDDLE CLASS OR
WELL-OFF KIDS, THEY GET OUT OF

3052
01:34:20,831 --> 01:34:23,532
WELL-OFF KIDS, THEY GET OUT OF
SCHOOL IN THE SPRING OR EARLY

3053
01:34:23,534 --> 01:34:25,367
SCHOOL IN THE SPRING OR EARLY
SUMMER, HAVING GONE TO 180, 185,

3054
01:34:25,369 --> 01:34:26,902
SUMMER, HAVING GONE TO 180, 185,
WHATEVER THE DAYS ARE IN THEIR

3055
01:34:26,904 --> 01:34:28,404
WHATEVER THE DAYS ARE IN THEIR
STATE, AND THEN THEY DO THINGS

3056
01:34:28,406 --> 01:34:30,005
STATE, AND THEN THEY DO THINGS
OVER THE SUMMER THAT KEEP THEM

3057
01:34:30,007 --> 01:34:30,338
OVER THE SUMMER THAT KEEP THEM
LEARNING.

3058
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:32,441
LEARNING.
WHERE A LOT OF DISADVANTAGED

3059
01:34:32,443 --> 01:34:35,544
WHERE A LOT OF DISADVANTAGED
KIDS GET OUT AND THEY ACTUALLY

3060
01:34:35,546 --> 01:34:36,512
KIDS GET OUT AND THEY ACTUALLY
LOSE SOME OF THE LEARNING

3061
01:34:36,514 --> 01:34:37,279
LOSE SOME OF THE LEARNING
THEY'VE GAINED DURING THE YEAR.

3062
01:34:37,281 --> 01:34:40,916
THEY'VE GAINED DURING THE YEAR.
SO I WANT VERY MUCH TO EXPAND

3063
01:34:40,918 --> 01:34:42,551
SO I WANT VERY MUCH TO EXPAND
THE SCHOOL DAY AND THE SCHOOL

3064
01:34:42,553 --> 01:34:45,454
THE SCHOOL DAY AND THE SCHOOL
YEAR AND PROVIDE MORE STRUCTURE

3065
01:34:45,456 --> 01:34:48,290
YEAR AND PROVIDE MORE STRUCTURE
STARTING WITH KIDS WHO WOULD BE

3066
01:34:48,292 --> 01:34:50,793
STARTING WITH KIDS WHO WOULD BE
MOST BENEFITED FROM IT, BUT I AM

3067
01:34:50,795 --> 01:34:52,694
MOST BENEFITED FROM IT, BUT I AM
IN FAVOR OF STATES LOOKING AT

3068
01:34:52,696 --> 01:34:54,663
IN FAVOR OF STATES LOOKING AT
HOW THEY MIGHT DO THAT FOR EVERY

3069
01:34:54,665 --> 01:34:55,964
HOW THEY MIGHT DO THAT FOR EVERY
STUDENT, BUT I'M MOST CONCERNED

3070
01:34:55,966 --> 01:34:59,100
STUDENT, BUT I'M MOST CONCERNED
ABOUT THE KIDS WHO ARE LEFT OUT

3071
01:34:59,102 --> 01:35:00,936
ABOUT THE KIDS WHO ARE LEFT OUT
AND LEFT BEHIND AND NEED MORE

3072
01:35:00,938 --> 01:35:03,439
AND LEFT BEHIND AND NEED MORE
TIME ON TASK.

3073
01:35:03,441 --> 01:35:04,039
TIME ON TASK.
THE RESEARCH ON THIS IS VERY

3074
01:35:04,041 --> 01:35:04,239
THE RESEARCH ON THIS IS VERY
CLEAR.

3075
01:35:04,241 --> 01:35:05,373
CLEAR.
IN FACT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE SAID I

3076
01:35:05,375 --> 01:35:09,177
IN FACT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE SAID I
WANT TO BE A GOOD PARTNER FOR

3077
01:35:09,179 --> 01:35:10,312
WANT TO BE A GOOD PARTNER FOR
EDUCATORS AND TEACHERS, BUT I

3078
01:35:10,314 --> 01:35:14,382
EDUCATORS AND TEACHERS, BUT I
WANT TO HELP THEM DO WHAT THEY

3079
01:35:14,384 --> 01:35:15,150
WANT TO HELP THEM DO WHAT THEY
KNOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

3080
01:35:15,152 --> 01:35:16,718
KNOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.
WE NEED BETTER AND FEWER TESTS.

3081
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,420
WE NEED BETTER AND FEWER TESTS.
NOT MORE TESTS.

3082
01:35:18,422 --> 01:35:19,588
NOT MORE TESTS.
WE NEED MORE SUPPORT IN THE

3083
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:20,722
WE NEED MORE SUPPORT IN THE
CLASSROOM BECAUSE A LOT OF KIDS

3084
01:35:20,724 --> 01:35:21,990
CLASSROOM BECAUSE A LOT OF KIDS
COME WITH NEEDS, AND AS THE

3085
01:35:21,992 --> 01:35:24,493
COME WITH NEEDS, AND AS THE
REVEREND WAS SAYING, A LOT OF

3086
01:35:24,495 --> 01:35:25,661
REVEREND WAS SAYING, A LOT OF
KIDS WHO HAVE CHALLENGES AT
