YOU KNOW, OPPOSING HIM?

711
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:07,891
YOU KNOW, OPPOSING HIM?
AND MY POINT IS THAT I WILL --

712
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,192
AND MY POINT IS THAT I WILL --
THESE ARE GREAT ORGANIZATIONS.

THESE ARE GREAT ORGANIZATIONS.
I MET WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

714
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,663
I MET WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD.
THEY DO A FANTASTIC JOB, NOT

715
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,865
THEY DO A FANTASTIC JOB, NOT
ONLY IN DEFENDING WOMEN'S RIGHTS

716
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,334
ONLY IN DEFENDING WOMEN'S RIGHTS
IN GENERAL, BUT TALKING ABOUT

717
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,401
IN GENERAL, BUT TALKING ABOUT
SEXUALITY IN AMERICA.

00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,737
SEXUALITY IN AMERICA.
THEY ARE A FANTASTIC

722
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,276

SO THIS WAS SIMPLY A QUESTION OF
ENDORSEMENT POLICY, NOT WHETHER

PRESIDENT WOULD?
WHAT ABOUT THAT ASPECT?

741
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,204
WHAT ABOUT THAT ASPECT?
THAT'S WHAT HILLARY CLINTON

THAT'S WHAT HILLARY CLINTON
REPRESENTS ON ONE LEVEL TO

THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL IN

00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,344
THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL IN
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN'S

747
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:01,577
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN'S

>> OF COURSE, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

749
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,982
>> OF COURSE, I UNDERSTAND THAT.
BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT MY

750
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,750
BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT MY
RECORD, IN TERMS OF FIGHTING FOR

ARE VERY FEW MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,188
ARE VERY FEW MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
WHO HAVE A STRONGER RECORD.

IT WILL IMPACT WOMEN MORE THAN

IT WILL IMPACT WOMEN MORE THAN
MEN AS WE RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE

ON JANUARY 19th, YOU WERE

995
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,481
ON JANUARY 19th, YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S

996
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:52,715
TALKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S
EXPERIENCE ARGUMENT AND REFERRED

997
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:53,649
EXPERIENCE ARGUMENT AND REFERRED
TO DICK CHENEY.

998
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:55,851
TO DICK CHENEY.
YOU SAID HE HAD A LOT OF

999
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:56,652
YOU SAID HE HAD A LOT OF
EXPERIENCE, TOO.

1000
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,988
EXPERIENCE, TOO.
NOW, REFERRING TO DICK CHENEY

1001
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,889
NOW, REFERRING TO DICK CHENEY
WHEN TALKING ABOUT HILLARY

1002
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,791
WHEN TALKING ABOUT HILLARY
CLINTON, NOT EXACTLY THE MOST

1003
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,328
CLINTON, NOT EXACTLY THE MOST
HIGH BROW WAY TO CONDUCT THE

1004
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:05,695
HIGH BROW WAY TO CONDUCT THE
ELECTION.

1005
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,965
ELECTION.
>> MY ONLY POINT WAS SECRETARY

1006
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,032
>> MY ONLY POINT WAS SECRETARY
CLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE

1007
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,534
CLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE
OF THIS COUNTRY FOR FOUR YEARS.

1008
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,935
OF THIS COUNTRY FOR FOUR YEARS.
THAT IS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE.

1009
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,237
THAT IS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE.
THERE'S NO DEBATE ABOUT THAT.

1010
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,706
THERE'S NO DEBATE ABOUT THAT.
I WAS NOT SECRETARY OF STATE.

1011
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,742
I WAS NOT SECRETARY OF STATE.
BUT EXPERIENCE IS IMPORTANT, BUT

1012
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,811
BUT EXPERIENCE IS IMPORTANT, BUT
JUDGMENT IS ALSO IMPORTANT.

1013
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,046
JUDGMENT IS ALSO IMPORTANT.
AND MY OWN POINT WAS IN TALKING

1014
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,781
AND MY OWN POINT WAS IN TALKING
ABOUT DICK CHENEY, HE HAD A LOT

1015
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,150
ABOUT DICK CHENEY, HE HAD A LOT
OF EXPERIENCE, TOO.

1016
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,051
OF EXPERIENCE, TOO.
HIS POLICIES WITH REGARD TO

1017
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,622
HIS POLICIES WITH REGARD TO
FOREIGN AFFAIRS WAS AN ABSOLUTE

1018
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:32,888
FOREIGN AFFAIRS WAS AN ABSOLUTE
DISASTER.

1019
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,591
DISASTER.
SO EXPERIENCE IS IMPORTANT, BUT

1020
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:37,059
SO EXPERIENCE IS IMPORTANT, BUT
IT IS NOT THE ONLY THING.

1021
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,461
IT IS NOT THE ONLY THING.
AND I WOULD URGE PEOPLE TO CHECK

1022
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,763
AND I WOULD URGE PEOPLE TO CHECK
OUT MY VIEWS ON FOREIGN POLICY,

1023
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,865
OUT MY VIEWS ON FOREIGN POLICY,
HOW WE DEAL WITH ISIS, AND I

1024
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,066
HOW WE DEAL WITH ISIS, AND I
THINK THEY'LL MAKE A LOT OF

1025
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,568
THINK THEY'LL MAKE A LOT OF
SENSE TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA AND

1026
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,103
SENSE TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA AND
THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY.

1027
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:50,106
THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY.

PIERCE POLICEMAN'S ARMOR AND
PROTECTION.

1134
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:07,570
PROTECTION.
I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT THING.

1135
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,004
I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT THING.
AND ONE THAT SAID WE WANT TO

1136
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:09,972

HAVE SAFETY LOCKS FOR CHILDREN

00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:10,540
HAVE SAFETY LOCKS FOR CHILDREN
ON GUNS.

1138
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:11,941
ON GUNS.
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.

1139
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,676
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.
IT ALSO HAD A PROVISION IN IT

1140
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,311
IT ALSO HAD A PROVISION IN IT
WHICH SAYS THE FOLLOWING, AND

1141
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,713
WHICH SAYS THE FOLLOWING, AND
PEOPLE MAY DISAGREE WITH ME.

1142
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:17,547
PEOPLE MAY DISAGREE WITH ME.
THIS IS MY VIEW.

1143
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:20,817
THIS IS MY VIEW.
IF YOU ARE A SMALL GUN SHOP IN

1144
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,820
IF YOU ARE A SMALL GUN SHOP IN
VERMONT AND I LEGALLY SELL YOU A

VERMONT AND I LEGALLY SELL YOU A
WEAPON, OKAY, YOU GO OUT, BUY

WEAPON, OKAY, YOU GO OUT, BUY
THAT GUN LEGALLY AND YOU GO OUT

THAT GUN LEGALLY AND YOU GO OUT
AND KILL SOMEBODY.

1148
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:31,026
AND KILL SOMEBODY.
I THINK THE GUN SHOP OWNER

1149
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,995
I THINK THE GUN SHOP OWNER
SHOULD NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR

1150
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,063
SHOULD NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR
YOUR CRIMINAL ACT.

1151
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:35,732
YOUR CRIMINAL ACT.
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE.

1152
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,834
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE.
NOW WITHIN THAT BILL ALSO, THERE

1153
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,802
NOW WITHIN THAT BILL ALSO, THERE
WAS SOME ONEROUS PROVISIONS.

1154
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,970
WAS SOME ONEROUS PROVISIONS.
NOT GOOD PROVISIONS.

1155
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,805
NOT GOOD PROVISIONS.
WHAT HAPPENS IF A GUN

1156
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,006
WHAT HAPPENS IF A GUN
MANUFACTURER IS SELLING A WHOLE

MANUFACTURER IS SELLING A WHOLE
LOT OF GUNS INTO AN AREA FAR

LOT OF GUNS INTO AN AREA FAR
MORE GUNS THAN THAT AREA CAN

1159
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,044
MORE GUNS THAN THAT AREA CAN
CONSUME?

1160
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:50,780
CONSUME?
AND WHAT HAPPENS IF THAT GUN

1161
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:53,349
AND WHAT HAPPENS IF THAT GUN
OWNER, THAT GUN MANUFACTURER

1162
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,917
OWNER, THAT GUN MANUFACTURER
SHOULD KNOW THAT THOSE GUNS ARE

1163
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,621
SHOULD KNOW THAT THOSE GUNS ARE
GOING INTO CRIMINAL HANDS.

1164
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,256
GOING INTO CRIMINAL HANDS.
SHOULD THAT GUN MANUFACTURER BE

1165
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:01,023
SHOULD THAT GUN MANUFACTURER BE
HELD LIABLE?

1166

HELD LIABLE?
YES, HE SHOULD.

1167
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,794
YES, HE SHOULD.
SO I AM WILLING NOW TO LOOK AT

1168
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,295
SO I AM WILLING NOW TO LOOK AT
THAT LEGISLATION, MAINTAIN WHAT

THAT LEGISLATION, MAINTAIN WHAT
WAS GOOD IN IT, GET RID OF WHAT

WAS GOOD IN IT, GET RID OF WHAT
IS BAD IN IT.

WAYS?

1173
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,537

MANUFACTURER OR THEY DON'T.

THE FIRST ARGUMENT SEEMS TO MAKE

00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:22,011
THE FIRST ARGUMENT SEEMS TO MAKE
SENSE.

1177
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,746

WHY WOULD THEY BE EXPOSED TO

WHY WOULD THEY BE EXPOSED TO
LIABILITY.

WHY HAVING IT BOTH WAYS?

WHY SHOULD SOMEBODY BE BUYING

OWNER OR THE GUN MANUFACTURER

CANDIDATES TONIGHT, ABOUT 99%,

HAVE BEEN ON SOME FORM OF

YOU CANNOT, YOU CANNOT IMAGINE
HOW TENSE IT WAS BECAUSE A LOT

01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:17,550
HOW TENSE IT WAS BECAUSE A LOT
OF OUR FRIENDS, AND PARTNERS IN

OF OUR FRIENDS, AND PARTNERS IN
THE REGION, BASICALLY JUST

THE REGION, BASICALLY JUST
WANTED TO END THAT PROGRAM BY

2953
01:29:21,957 --> 01:29:22,721
WANTED TO END THAT PROGRAM BY
BOMBING THEM.

2954
01:29:22,723 --> 01:29:23,656
BOMBING THEM.
JUST BOMB THEM.

I SPENT A LOT OF MY TIME

2959
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:30,163
I SPENT A LOT OF MY TIME
EXPLAINING TO OUR FRIENDS, WHY

2960
01:29:30,165 --> 01:29:31,664
EXPLAINING TO OUR FRIENDS, WHY
THAT WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

2961
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:34,233
THAT WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA.
AND WE GOT THE NEGOTIATIONS

2962
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:35,801
AND WE GOT THE NEGOTIATIONS
SUCCESSFULLY DONE, WE DID PUT

2963
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:36,635
SUCCESSFULLY DONE, WE DID PUT
THE LID ON.

2964
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:38,804
THE LID ON.
SO THAT'S HOW I THOUGHT ABOUT.

THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

3006
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:51,377
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
SO, EVERY SITUATION IS

3007

SO, EVERY SITUATION IS
DIFFERENT.

3008

ONE SPECIFIC.
CRITICS WILL SAY THEY SEE THE

CRITICS WILL SAY THEY SEE THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHICH OF

WHERE NOW THINGS ARE LESS STABLE

3030
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:28,314
WHERE NOW THINGS ARE LESS STABLE
AROUND THE WORLD, CERTAINLY IN

3031
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:30,450
AROUND THE WORLD, CERTAINLY IN
THE WAR ON TERROR.

3032
01:31:30,452 --> 01:31:32,318
THE WAR ON TERROR.
SPECIFICALLY, SENATOR SANDERS,

SPECIFICALLY, SENATOR SANDERS,
EARLIER TONIGHT SAID YES, A LOT

3034
01:31:33,921 --> 01:31:35,455
EARLIER TONIGHT SAID YES, A LOT
OF EXPERIENCE, BUT DID DOESN'T

3035
01:31:35,457 --> 01:31:36,889
OF EXPERIENCE, BUT DID DOESN'T
ALWAYS TRANSLATE INTO THE BEST

3036
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:38,958
ALWAYS TRANSLATE INTO THE BEST
JUDGMENT, AND HE CITED YOUR VOTE

3037
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,194
JUDGMENT, AND HE CITED YOUR VOTE
ON THE WAR IN IRAQ.

3038
01:31:41,196 --> 01:31:42,995
ON THE WAR IN IRAQ.
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THOSE TWO

3039
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:43,296
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THOSE TWO
CRITICISMS?

3040
01:31:43,298 --> 01:31:45,131
CRITICISMS?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, AFTER I

>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, AFTER I
MUCH LONGER HISTORY THAN ONE

3042
01:31:47,102 --> 01:31:48,867
MUCH LONGER HISTORY THAN ONE
VOTE WHICH I SAID WAS A MISTAKE

3043
01:31:48,869 --> 01:31:49,935
VOTE WHICH I SAID WAS A MISTAKE
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THAT WAS

3044
01:31:49,937 --> 01:31:51,404
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THAT WAS
DONE AND HOW THE BUSH

3045
01:31:51,406 --> 01:31:52,572
DONE AND HOW THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION HANDLED IT.

3046
01:31:52,574 --> 01:31:55,641
ADMINISTRATION HANDLED IT.
BUT I THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC

3047
01:31:55,643 --> 01:31:57,276
BUT I THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
HAS SEEN ME EXERCISING JUDGMENT

3048
01:31:57,278 --> 01:31:59,178
HAS SEEN ME EXERCISING JUDGMENT
IN A LOT OF OTHER WAYS, AND IN

3049
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,080
IN A LOT OF OTHER WAYS, AND IN
FACT, WHEN THAT HARD PRIMARY

3050
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:02,681
FACT, WHEN THAT HARD PRIMARY
CAMPAIGN WAS OVER, AND I WENT TO

3051
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:04,217
CAMPAIGN WAS OVER, AND I WENT TO
WORK FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HE

3052
01:32:04,219 --> 01:32:05,618
WORK FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HE
ENDED UP ASKING ME TO BE

3053
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:06,252
ENDED UP ASKING ME TO BE
SECRETARY OF STATE, IT WAS

3054
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:08,921
SECRETARY OF STATE, IT WAS
BECAUSE HE TRUSTED MY JUDGMENT.

3055
01:32:08,923 --> 01:32:11,257
BECAUSE HE TRUSTED MY JUDGMENT.
AND WE WORK SIDE BY SIDE OVER

3056
01:32:11,259 --> 01:32:13,025
AND WE WORK SIDE BY SIDE OVER
THOSE FOUR YEARS.

3057
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:14,627
THOSE FOUR YEARS.
AND THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WERE

3058
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:15,728
AND THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WERE
WHEN HE BECAME PRESIDENT.

3059
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,430
WHEN HE BECAME PRESIDENT.
AS I JUST SAID, IRAN ON THE WAY

3060
01:32:17,432 --> 01:32:19,365
AS I JUST SAID, IRAN ON THE WAY
TO A NUCLEAR WEAPON, WHICH WOULD

3061
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,300
TO A NUCLEAR WEAPON, WHICH WOULD
HAVE DESTABILIZED THE ENTIRE

3062
01:32:21,302 --> 01:32:23,603
HAVE DESTABILIZED THE ENTIRE
MIDDLE EAST, CREATED AN ARMS

3063
01:32:23,605 --> 01:32:24,903
MIDDLE EAST, CREATED AN ARMS
RACE, THE LIKE OF WHICH WE HAVE

3064
01:32:24,905 --> 01:32:26,672
RACE, THE LIKE OF WHICH WE HAVE
NEVER SEEN, WE HAVE THUNS OF

3065
01:32:26,674 --> 01:32:27,906
NEVER SEEN, WE HAVE THUNS OF
THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN TROOPS IN

3066
01:32:27,908 --> 01:32:30,243
THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN TROOPS IN
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.

3067
01:32:30,245 --> 01:32:32,945
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.
OUR BEST ALLIES IN FRIENDS IN

3068
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:35,881
OUR BEST ALLIES IN FRIENDS IN
EUROPE AND ASIA WERE REALLY PUT

3069
01:32:35,883 --> 01:32:37,483
EUROPE AND ASIA WERE REALLY PUT
OUT WITH US BECAUSE OF THE WAY

3070
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:39,885
OUT WITH US BECAUSE OF THE WAY
THEY'D BEEN TREATED BY THE BUSH

3071
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:42,188
THEY'D BEEN TREATED BY THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, AND WERE VERY

3072
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:43,022
ADMINISTRATION, AND WERE VERY
SKEPTICAL THAT THE UNITED STATES

3073
01:32:43,024 --> 01:32:45,824
SKEPTICAL THAT THE UNITED STATES
WAS A GOOD ALLY ANY LONGER AND

3074
01:32:45,826 --> 01:32:48,261
WAS A GOOD ALLY ANY LONGER AND
WANTED TO LEAVE THE WORLD TOWARD

3075
01:32:48,263 --> 01:32:49,728
WANTED TO LEAVE THE WORLD TOWARD
PEACE AND PROSPERITY AND

3076
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:49,995
PEACE AND PROSPERITY AND
SECURITY.

3077
01:32:49,997 --> 01:32:51,730
SECURITY.
I SPENT SO MUCH OF MY TIME

3078
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:52,498
I SPENT SO MUCH OF MY TIME
GETTING BACK THE CONFIDENCE AND

3079
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,133
GETTING BACK THE CONFIDENCE AND
THE TRUST OF OUR FRIENDS AND

3080
01:32:54,135 --> 01:32:55,635
THE TRUST OF OUR FRIENDS AND
ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD.

3081
01:32:55,637 --> 01:32:57,936
ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD.
