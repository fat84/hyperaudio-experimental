BUT I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

411
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,656
BUT I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
DESERVE TO KNOW SPECIFICALLY HOW

SO IF YOU ARE HAVING MEDICARE
FOR ALL, SINGLE PAYOR, YOU NEED

428
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,283
FOR ALL, SINGLE PAYOR, YOU NEED

PRESIDENT OBAMA'S POLICING

00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:31,308
BUT WE HAVE TO RESTORE POLICING
THAT WILL ACTUALLY PROTECT THE

COMMUNITIES THAT POLICE OFFICERS
ARE SWORN TO PROTECT.

1557
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:02,831
TRYING TO DIVIDE US UP.
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO RIGHT NOW IS

1558
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,434
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO RIGHT NOW IS
BRING OUR PEOPLE TOGETHER AND

1559
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:07,503
BRING OUR PEOPLE TOGETHER AND
UNDERSTAND THAT WE MUST PROVIDE

1560
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:09,705
UNDERSTAND THAT WE MUST PROVIDE
A PATH TOWARDS CITIZENSHIP FOR

1561
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:11,840
A PATH TOWARDS CITIZENSHIP FOR
11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE.

1562
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,309
11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE.

ONE, WITH RESPECT TO THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN CHILDREN.

1565
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:19,848
AMERICAN CHILDREN.
I MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THOSE

1566
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,151
I MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THOSE
CHILDREN NEEDED TO BE PROCESSED

1567
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:22,618
CHILDREN NEEDED TO BE PROCESSED
APPROPRIATELY.

1568
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,787
APPROPRIATELY.
BUT WE ALSO HAD TO SEND A

BUT WE ALSO HAD TO SEND A
MESSAGE TO FAMILIES AND

00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:28,023
MESSAGE TO FAMILIES AND
COMMUNITIES IN CENTRAL AMERICA

COMMUNITIES IN CENTRAL AMERICA
NOT TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN ON

1572
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:34,330
THIS DANGEROUS JOURNEY IN THE
HANDS OF SMUGGLERS.

00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:36,332
HANDS OF SMUGGLERS.
I'VE ALSO CALLED FOR THE ENDS OF

BUT IN TERMS OF THE CHILDREN, I

BUT IN TERMS OF THE CHILDREN, I
DON'T KNOW TO WHOM YOU ARE

THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO ARE

00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,790
THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO ARE
LEAVING COUNTRIES AND

00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:37,192
LEAVING COUNTRIES AND
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEIR LIVES

THAT WAS THE FACT.

1611
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:41,063
THAT WAS THE FACT.
I DON'T THINK WE USE THEM TO

1619
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,277

THE FACT IS THAT THERE WAS A

1620
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:56,044
THE FACT IS THAT THERE WAS A
GREAT EFFORT MADE BY THE OBAMA

BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT SO MANY OF
THESE CHILDREN WERE BEING

THESE CHILDREN WERE BEING
ABUSED, BEING TREATED TERRIBLY

KIND OF PROCESS WITHOUT SOME ONE

KIND OF PROCESS WITHOUT SOME ONE
WHO SPEAKS AND ADVOCATES FOR

WHO SPEAKS AND ADVOCATES FOR
THAT CHILD.

1636
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,205
THAT CHILD.
SO THAT THE RIGHT DECISION

1637
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:25,040
SO THAT THE RIGHT DECISION
HOPEFULLY CAN BE MADE.

00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:08,343
WE HAVE MORE THAN 750,000
DONORS.

1849
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:10,278

THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM COULD FACE.

2056
01:05:32,196 --> 01:05:36,598
THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM COULD FACE.
IT WAS AN INVESTMENT BANK LEEMAN

IT GOES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
WE HAVE DODD-FRANK.

2504
01:19:17,954 --> 01:19:19,119
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT
WAS THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION.

WAS THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION.
SO HE HAD TO LEAVE THE SITUATION

RUSSIA'S AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS IN
THE CRIMEA AND IN UKRAINE HAVE

GOING TO GO UNMATCHED.
THAT HE IS NOT GOING TO GET AWAY

2688
01:25:01,064 --> 01:25:02,296

WITH AGGRESSIVE ACTION.

2689
01:25:02,298 --> 01:25:04,198

THE AGREEMENT ON HUMANITARIAN

2706
01:25:35,397 --> 01:25:37,832
THE AGREEMENT ON HUMANITARIAN
RELIEF NOW NEEDS TO BE

2707
01:25:37,834 --> 01:25:39,734
RELIEF NOW NEEDS TO BE
IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE THERE ARE

2708
01:25:39,736 --> 01:25:41,368

BE IMPLEMENTED MORE QUICKLY THAN

2714
01:25:52,014 --> 01:25:54,348
BE IMPLEMENTED MORE QUICKLY THAN
THE SCHEDULE THAT THE RUSSIANS

THE SCHEDULE THAT THE RUSSIANS
AGREED TO.

2716
01:25:55,084 --> 01:25:57,251
AGREED TO.
THE RUSSIANS WANTED TO BUY TIME.

2717
01:25:57,253 --> 01:25:58,886
THE RUSSIANS WANTED TO BUY TIME.
ARE THEY BUYING TIME TO CONTINUE

2718
01:25:58,888 --> 01:26:00,621
ARE THEY BUYING TIME TO CONTINUE
THEIR BOMBARDMENT ON BEHALF OF

2719

THEIR BOMBARDMENT ON BEHALF OF
THE ASSAD REGIME TO FURTHER

OPPOSITION, WHICH WOULD BE A

2722
01:26:09,098 --> 01:26:12,432
OPPOSITION, WHICH WOULD BE A
GRAVE DISSERVICE TO ANY KIND OF

2723
01:26:12,434 --> 01:26:13,500
GRAVE DISSERVICE TO ANY KIND OF
EVENTUAL CEASEFIRE.

2724
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:15,602
EVENTUAL CEASEFIRE.
SO I KNOW SECRETARY KERRY IS

2725
01:26:15,604 --> 01:26:17,537

WORKING EXTREMELY HARD TO TRY TO

BECAUSE WE'VE GOT IRAN AS A BIG

2741
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:50,671
