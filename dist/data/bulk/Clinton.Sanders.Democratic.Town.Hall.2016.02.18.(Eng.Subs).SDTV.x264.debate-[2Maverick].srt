WALL STREET.
IMAGINE THAT.

2720
01:24:31,739 --> 01:24:33,807
IMAGINE THAT.
IF YOU THOUGHT WE HAD SCANDALS

2721
01:24:33,809 --> 01:24:34,607
IF YOU THOUGHT WE HAD SCANDALS
AND COLLAPSE BEFORE, THINK OF

2722
01:24:34,609 --> 01:24:36,176
AND COLLAPSE BEFORE, THINK OF
THAT.

2723

THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT
WAYS I'M LOOKING AT AND I'LL

2730
01:24:46,121 --> 01:24:47,386
WAYS I'M LOOKING AT AND I'LL
HAVE TO TALK WITH THE CONGRESS

2731
01:24:47,388 --> 01:24:48,621
HAVE TO TALK WITH THE CONGRESS
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE

2732
01:24:48,623 --> 01:24:49,989
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE
BEST WAY FORWARD.

2733
01:24:49,991 --> 01:24:51,357
BEST WAY FORWARD.
WE CAN RAISE THE CAP AND GET

2734
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:52,692
WE CAN RAISE THE CAP AND GET
MORE MONEY THAT WAY.

2735
01:24:52,694 --> 01:24:54,727
MORE MONEY THAT WAY.
WE CAN GO AFTER THE EXISTING

2736
01:24:54,729 --> 01:24:56,329
WE CAN GO AFTER THE EXISTING
PERCENTAGE THAT COMES OUT OF

2737
01:24:56,331 --> 01:24:57,931
PERCENTAGE THAT COMES OUT OF
PEOPLE'S PAYCHECKS, WE CAN GO

2738
01:24:57,933 --> 01:24:59,565
PEOPLE'S PAYCHECKS, WE CAN GO
AFTER WHAT'S CALLED PASSIVE

2739
01:24:59,567 --> 01:25:00,967
AFTER WHAT'S CALLED PASSIVE
INCOME SO RICH PEOPLE HAVE TO

2740
01:25:00,969 --> 01:25:03,002
INCOME SO RICH PEOPLE HAVE TO
PAY ON ALL THEIR INCOME, NOT

2741
01:25:03,004 --> 01:25:05,071
PAY ON ALL THEIR INCOME, NOT
JUST THEIR EARNED INCOME BECAUSE

2742
01:25:05,073 --> 01:25:06,339
JUST THEIR EARNED INCOME BECAUSE
THEY LIVE OFF CAPITAL GAINS AND

2743
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:13,847
THEY LIVE OFF CAPITAL GAINS AND
INVESTMENT INCOME.

2744
01:25:13,849 --> 01:25:16,249
INVESTMENT INCOME.
WE HAVE TOO MANY SOCIAL SECURITY

2745
01:25:16,251 --> 01:25:16,950
WE HAVE TOO MANY SOCIAL SECURITY
RECIPIENTS RIGHT NOW WHO ARE

2746
01:25:16,952 --> 01:25:20,419
RECIPIENTS RIGHT NOW WHO ARE
BARELY MAKING IT.

2747
01:25:20,421 --> 01:25:22,488
BARELY MAKING IT.
AND THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE

2748
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:23,189
AND THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE
NUMBER ONE THEY WERE LOW WAGE

2749
01:25:23,191 --> 01:25:25,524
NUMBER ONE THEY WERE LOW WAGE
WORKERS DURING THEIR LIFETIME.

2750
01:25:25,526 --> 01:25:27,693
WORKERS DURING THEIR LIFETIME.
THEY DIDN'T PUT THAT MUCH INTO

2751
01:25:27,695 --> 01:25:29,528
THEY DIDN'T PUT THAT MUCH INTO
THE FUND SO NOW WHEN THEY NEED

2752
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:30,496
THE FUND SO NOW WHEN THEY NEED
IT, THEY'RE CAPPED OUT.

2753
01:25:30,498 --> 01:25:31,397
IT, THEY'RE CAPPED OUT.
THEY DON'T GET WHAT THEY NEED TO

2754
01:25:31,399 --> 01:25:33,666
THEY DON'T GET WHAT THEY NEED TO
LIVE ON.

2755
01:25:33,668 --> 01:25:36,602
LIVE ON.
WE ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM OF OLDER

2756
01:25:36,604 --> 01:25:38,004
WE ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM OF OLDER
WOMEN WHO MAY NOT HAVE WORKED AT

2757
01:25:38,006 --> 01:25:38,938
WOMEN WHO MAY NOT HAVE WORKED AT
ALL DURING THEIR LIFETIMES.

2758
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:41,674
ALL DURING THEIR LIFETIMES.
THEY TOOK CARE OF HOMES AND

2759
01:25:41,676 --> 01:25:42,175
THEY TOOK CARE OF HOMES AND
FAMILIES.

2760
01:25:42,177 --> 01:25:47,113
FAMILIES.
THEY CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR

2761
01:25:47,115 --> 01:25:47,613
THEY CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR
COMMUNITIES.

2762
01:25:47,615 --> 01:25:48,547
COMMUNITIES.
SO THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH TO DRAW

2763
01:25:48,549 --> 01:25:49,682
SO THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH TO DRAW
ON EITHER AND THEN ONE OF THE

2764
01:25:49,684 --> 01:25:51,284
ON EITHER AND THEN ONE OF THE
SADDEST PROBLEMS I'M GOING TO GO

2765
01:25:51,286 --> 01:25:54,854
SADDEST PROBLEMS I'M GOING TO GO
AFTER IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A

2766
01:25:54,856 --> 01:25:57,857
AFTER IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A
HUSBAND DIES AND THEN A WIDOW

2767
01:25:57,859 --> 01:26:01,627
HUSBAND DIES AND THEN A WIDOW
LOSES HALF OF HER SOCIAL

2768
01:26:01,629 --> 01:26:02,128
LOSES HALF OF HER SOCIAL
SECURITY PAYMENT.

2769
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:05,398
SECURITY PAYMENT.
IF SHE'S NOT MAKING MUCH TO

2770
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,432
IF SHE'S NOT MAKING MUCH TO
BEGIN WITH, I'VE MET A LOT OF

2771
01:26:06,434 --> 01:26:08,201
BEGIN WITH, I'VE MET A LOT OF
THESE WOMEN, THEY'RE LOSING

2772
01:26:08,203 --> 01:26:08,935
THESE WOMEN, THEY'RE LOSING
THEIR HOMES, THEY'RE REALLY IN

2773
01:26:08,937 --> 01:26:11,037
THEIR HOMES, THEY'RE REALLY IN
FINANCIAL DISTRESS.

2774
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:12,338
FINANCIAL DISTRESS.
SO WE'RE GOING TO GET IT MORE

2775
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:14,840
SO WE'RE GOING TO GET IT MORE
SOLVENT AND FIX SOME OF THE

2776
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:15,875
SOLVENT AND FIX SOME OF THE
PROBLEMS OF THE PEOPLE MOST IN

2777
01:26:15,877 --> 01:26:16,609
PROBLEMS OF THE PEOPLE MOST IN
NEED AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO AS

2778
01:26:16,611 --> 01:26:23,682
NEED AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO AS
PRESIDENT.

THAT YOU MENTIONED AS YOU KNOW
PEOPLE PAY SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES

PEOPLE PAY SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES
ON INCOME UP TO ABOUT $120,000.

SENATOR SANDERS WANTS TO CHANGE
THAT.

2785
01:26:32,593 --> 01:26:33,826
THAT.
YOU ARE WERE OPPOSED TO RAISING

2786
01:26:33,828 --> 01:26:35,628
YOU ARE WERE OPPOSED TO RAISING
THE CAP IN 2008.

2787
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:36,796
THE CAP IN 2008.
THIS TIME AROUND YOU SEEM TO BE

2788
01:26:36,798 --> 01:26:41,700
THIS TIME AROUND YOU SEEM TO BE
CONSIDERING IT.

2789
01:26:41,702 --> 01:26:43,036
CONSIDERING IT.
SHOULD PEOPLE START PAYING

2790
01:26:43,038 --> 01:26:43,769
SHOULD PEOPLE START PAYING
SOCIAL SECURITY INCOME TAXES ON

2791
01:26:43,771 --> 01:26:50,743
SOCIAL SECURITY INCOME TAXES ON
OVER $120,000?

2792
01:26:50,745 --> 01:26:54,880
OVER $120,000?
>> IT COULD BE OVER $250,000.

2793
01:26:54,882 --> 01:26:57,283
>> IT COULD BE OVER $250,000.
IT COULD BE A HIGHER AMOUNT, BUT

2794
01:26:57,285 --> 01:26:59,352
IT COULD BE A HIGHER AMOUNT, BUT
THIS IS THE KIND OF ISSUE THAT

2795
01:26:59,354 --> 01:27:01,687
THIS IS THE KIND OF ISSUE THAT
YOU'VE GOT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

2796
01:27:01,689 --> 01:27:03,622
YOU'VE GOT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE THE CONGRESS MIGHT BE.

2797
01:27:03,624 --> 01:27:04,790
WHERE THE CONGRESS MIGHT BE.
SO I'VE LAID OUT A NUMBER OF

2798
01:27:04,792 --> 01:27:06,059
SO I'VE LAID OUT A NUMBER OF
DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO GET THE

2799
01:27:06,061 --> 01:27:07,360
DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO GET THE
MONEY.

2800
01:27:07,362 --> 01:27:09,028
MONEY.
THE OTHER ONE THAT I MENTIONED

2801
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:11,130
THE OTHER ONE THAT I MENTIONED
TO THE GENTLEMAN IS PUTTING THE

2802
01:27:11,132 --> 01:27:14,000
TO THE GENTLEMAN IS PUTTING THE
-- PUTTING THE PERCENTAGE ON

2803
01:27:14,002 --> 01:27:16,302
-- PUTTING THE PERCENTAGE ON
PASSIVE INCOME SO THAT PEOPLE

2804
01:27:16,304 --> 01:27:17,870
PASSIVE INCOME SO THAT PEOPLE
WITH A LOT OF INCOME, BUT FROM

2805
01:27:17,872 --> 01:27:20,306
WITH A LOT OF INCOME, BUT FROM
CAPITAL GAINS AND INVESTMENTS --

2806
01:27:20,308 --> 01:27:21,841
CAPITAL GAINS AND INVESTMENTS --
THEY DON'T PAY MUCH INTO SOCIAL

2807
01:27:21,843 --> 01:27:22,875
THEY DON'T PAY MUCH INTO SOCIAL
SECURITY, BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF

2808
01:27:22,877 --> 01:27:23,742
SECURITY, BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF
MONEY, THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY

2809
01:27:23,744 --> 01:27:25,311
MONEY, THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY
MORE.

2810
01:27:25,313 --> 01:27:26,012
MORE.
SO THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF THE

2811
01:27:26,014 --> 01:27:28,014
SO THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF THE
OPTIONS.

2812
01:27:28,016 --> 01:27:30,216
OPTIONS.
I THINK WE CAN PICK ONE OR MORE

2813
01:27:30,218 --> 01:27:31,617
I THINK WE CAN PICK ONE OR MORE
OF THOSE, BUT THE GOAL IS TO GET

2814
01:27:31,619 --> 01:27:34,520
OF THOSE, BUT THE GOAL IS TO GET
MORE MONEY INTO THE TRUST FUND.

2815
01:27:34,522 --> 01:27:36,889
MORE MONEY INTO THE TRUST FUND.
>> WOULD YOU EVER IMAGINE

2816
01:27:36,891 --> 01:27:37,590
>> WOULD YOU EVER IMAGINE
